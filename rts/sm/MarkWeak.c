   Weak Pointers

   traverseWeakPtrList is called possibly many times during garbage
   collection.  It returns a flag indicating whether it did any work
   (i.e. called evacuate on any live pointers).

   Invariant: traverseWeakPtrList is called when the heap is in an
   idempotent state.  That means that there are no pending
   evacuate/scavenge operations.  This invariant helps the weak
   pointer code decide which weak pointers are dead - if there are no
   new live weak pointers, then all the currently unreachable ones are
   dead.

   For generational GC: we don't try to finalize weak pointers in
   older generations than the one we're collecting.

   There are three distinct stages to processing weak pointers:

   - weak_stage == WeakPtrs

     We process all the weak pointers whose keys are alive (evacuate
     their values and finalizers), and repeat until we can find no new
     live keys.  If no live keys are found in this pass, then we
     evacuate the finalizers of all the dead weak pointers in order to
     run them.

   - weak_stage == WeakThreads

     Now, we discover which *threads* are still alive.  Pointers to
     threads from the all_threads and main thread lists are the
     weakest of all: a pointer from the finalizer of a dead weak
     pointer can keep a thread alive.  Any threads found to be unreachable
     are evacuated and placed on the resurrected_threads list so we
     can send them a signal later.

   - weak_stage == WeakDone

     No more evacuation is done.

   -------------------------------------------------------------------------- */

 * Note [Weak pointer processing and the non-moving GC]
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 * When using the non-moving GC we defer weak pointer processing
 * until the concurrent marking phase as weaks in the non-moving heap may be
 * keyed on objects living in the non-moving generation. To accomplish this
 * initWeakForGC keeps all weak pointers on oldest_gen->weak_ptr_list, where
 * nonmovingCollect will find them. From there they will be moved to
 * nonmoving_old_weak_ptr_list. During the mark loop we will move weaks with
 * reachable keys to nonmoving_weak_ptr_list. At the end of concurrent marking
 * we tidy the weak list (in nonmovingTidyWeakList) and perform another set of
 * marking as necessary, just as is done in tidyWeakList.
 *
 * Note that this treatment takes advantage of the fact that we usually need
 * not worry about Weak#s living in the non-moving heap but being keyed on an
 * object in the moving heap since the Weak# must be strictly older than the
 * key. Such objects would otherwise pose a problem since the non-moving
 * collector would be unable to safely determine the liveness of the key.
 * In the rare case that we *do* see such a key (e.g. in the case of a
 * pinned ByteArray# living in a partially-filled accumulator block)
 * the nonmoving collector assumes that it is live.
 *
