-- | Note [Completion Ports]
-- When an I/O operation has been queued by an operation
-- (ReadFile/WriteFile/etc) it is placed in a queue that the driver uses when
-- servicing IRQs.  This queue has some important properties:
--
-- 1.) It is not an ordered queue.  Requests may be performed out of order as
--     as the OS's native I/O manager may try to re-order requests such that as
--     few random seeks as possible are needed to complete the pending
--     operations.  As such do not assume a fixed order between something being
--     queued and dequeued.
--
-- 2.) Operations may skip the queue entirely.  In which case they do not end in
--     in this function. (This is an optimization flag we have turned on. See
--     `openFile`.)
--
-- 3.) Across this call the specified OVERLAPPED_ENTRY buffer MUST remain live,
--     and the buffer for an I/O operation cannot be freed or moved until
--     `getOverlappedResult` says it's done.  The reason is the kernel may not
--     have fully released the buffer, or finished writing to it when this
--     operation returns.  Failure to adhere to this will cause your IRQs to be
--     silently dropped and your program will never receive a completion for it.
--     This means that the OVERLAPPED buffer must also remain valid for the
--     duration of the call and as such must be allocated on the unmanaged heap.
--
-- 4.) When a thread calls this method it is associated with the I/O manager's
--     worker threads pool.  You should always use dedicated threads for this
--     since the OS I/O manager will now monitor the threads.  If the thread
--     becomes blocked for whatever reason, the Haskell I/O manager will wake up
--     another threads from it's pool to service the remaining results.
--     A new thread will also be woken up from the pool when the previous thread
--     is busy servicing requests and new requests have finished.  For this
--     reason the Haskell I/O manager multiplexes I/O operations from N haskell
--     threads into 1 completion port, which is serviced by M native threads in
--     an asynchronous method. This allows it to scale efficiently.

-- Request management

-- [Note AsyncHandles]
-- In `winio` we have designed it to work in asynchronous mode always.
-- According to the MSDN documentation[1][2], when a handle is not opened
-- in asynchronous mode then the operation would simply work but operate
-- synchronously.
--
-- This seems to happen as documented for `File` handles, but `pipes` don't
-- seem to follow this documented behavior and so are a problem.
-- Under `msys2` your standard handles are actually pipes, not console
-- handles or files.  As such running under an msys2 console causes a hang
-- as the pipe read never returns.
--
-- [1] https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/fileio/synchronous-and-asynchronous-i-o
-- [2] https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/sync/synchronization-and-overlapped-input-and-output
--
-- As such we need to annotate all NativeHandles with a Boolean to indicate
-- wether it's an asynchronous handle or not.
-- This allows us to manually wait for the completion instead of relying
-- on the I/O system to do the right thing.  As we have been using the
-- buffers in async mode we may not have moved the file pointer on the kernel
-- object, as such we still need to give an `OVERLAPPED` structure, but we
-- instead create an event object that we can wait on.
--
-- As documented in MSDN this even object must be in manual reset mode.  This
-- approach gives us the flexibility, with minimum impact to support both
-- synchronous and asynchronous access.
--
-- Additional approaches explored
--
-- Normally the I/O system is in full control of all Handles it creates, with
-- one big exception: inheritance.
--
-- For any `HANDLE` we inherit we don't know how it's been open.  A different
-- solution I have explored was to try to detect the `HANDLE` mode.
-- But this approach would never work for a few reasons:
--
-- 1. The presence of an asynchronous flag does not indicate that we are able
--    to handle the operation asynchronously.  In particular, just because a
--    `HANDLE` is open in async mode, it may not be associated with our
--    completion port.
-- 2. One can only associate a `HANDLE` to a *single* completion port.  As
--    such, if the handle is opened in async mode but already registered to a
--    completion port then we can't use it asynchronously.
-- 3. You can only associate a completion port once, even if it's the same
--    port.  This means were we to strap a `HANDLE` of it's `NativeHandle`
--    wrapper and then wrap it again, we can't retest as the result would be
--    invalid.  This is an issue because to pass `HANDLE`s we have to pass
--    the native OS Handle not the Haskell one. i.e. remote-iserv.
