-- >>> last (dropWhileEnd (< 0) [undefined, 1])
-- *** Exception: Prelude.undefined

    (hds, tls) = unzip [(hd, tl) | hd : tl <- xss]
    combine y h ys t = (y:h) : transpose (ys:t)
    {-# NOINLINE combine #-}
  {- Implementation note:
  If the bottom part of the function was written as such:

  ```
  transpose ((x : xs) : xss) = (x:hds) : transpose (xs:tls)
  where
    (hds,tls) = hdstls
    hdstls = unzip [(hd, tl) | hd : tl <- xss]
    {-# NOINLINE hdstls #-}
  ```
  Here are the steps that would take place:

  1. We allocate a thunk, `hdstls`, representing the result of unzipping.
  2. We allocate selector thunks, `hds` and `tls`, that deconstruct `hdstls`.
  3. Install `hds` as the tail of the result head and pass `xs:tls` to
     the recursive call in the result tail.

  Once optimised, this code would amount to:

  ```
  transpose ((x : xs) : xss) = (x:hds) : (let tls = snd hdstls in transpose (xs:tls))
  where
    hds = fst hdstls
    hdstls = unzip [(hd, tl) | hd : tl <- xss]
    {-# NOINLINE hdstls #-}
  ```

  In particular, GHC does not produce the `tls` selector thunk immediately;
  rather, it waits to do so until the tail of the result is actually demanded.
  So when `hds` is demanded, that does not resolve `snd hdstls`; the tail of the
  result keeps `hdstls` alive.

  By writing `combine` and making it NOINLINE, we prevent GHC from delaying
  the selector thunk allocation, requiring that `hds` and `tls` are actually
  allocated to be passed to `combine`.

The inline principle for @unzip{4,5,6,7}@ is the same as 'unzip'/'unzip3' in
"GHC.List".
The 'unzip'/'unzip3' functions are inlined so that the `foldr` with which they
are defined has an opportunity to fuse.

As such, since there are not any differences between 2/3-ary 'unzip' and its
n-ary counterparts below aside from the number of arguments, the `INLINE`
pragma should be replicated in the @unzipN@ functions below as well.

-- | The 'deleteFirstsBy' function takes a predicate and two lists and
-- returns the first list with the first occurrence of each element of
-- the second list removed. This is the non-overloaded version of '(\\)'.
--
-- The second list must be finite, but the first may be infinite.
--

deleteFirstsBy eq       =  foldl (flip (deleteBy eq))

-- | The 'group' function takes a list and returns a list of lists such
-- that the concatenation of the result is equal to the argument.  Moreover,
-- each sublist in the result is non-empty and all elements are equal
-- to the first one.  For example,
--
-- >>> group "Mississippi"
-- ["M","i","ss","i","ss","i","pp","i"]
--
-- 'group' is a special case of 'groupBy', which allows the programmer to supply
-- their own equality test.
--
-- It's often preferable to use @Data.List.NonEmpty.@'Data.List.NonEmpty.group',
-- which provides type-level guarantees of non-emptiness of inner lists.
--
group                   :: Eq a => [a] -> [[a]]
group                   =  groupBy (==)

-- | The 'groupBy' function is the non-overloaded version of 'group'.
--
-- When a supplied relation is not transitive, it is important
-- to remember that equality is checked against the first element in the group,
-- not against the nearest neighbour:
--
-- >>> groupBy (\a b -> b - a < 5) [0..19]
-- [[0,1,2,3,4],[5,6,7,8,9],[10,11,12,13,14],[15,16,17,18,19]]
--
-- It's often preferable to use @Data.List.NonEmpty.@'Data.List.NonEmpty.groupBy',
-- which provides type-level guarantees of non-emptiness of inner lists.
--
groupBy                 :: (a -> a -> Bool) -> [a] -> [[a]]
groupBy _  []           =  []
groupBy eq (x:xs)       =  (x:ys) : groupBy eq zs
                           where (ys,zs) = span (eq x) xs

-- | The 'inits' function returns all initial segments of the argument,
-- shortest first.  For example,
--
-- >>> inits "abc"
-- ["","a","ab","abc"]
--
-- Note that 'inits' has the following strictness property:
-- @inits (xs ++ _|_) = inits xs ++ _|_@
--
-- In particular,
-- @inits _|_ = [] : _|_@
--
-- 'inits' is semantically equivalent to @'map' 'reverse' . 'scanl' ('flip' (:)) []@,
-- but under the hood uses a queue to amortize costs of 'reverse'.
--
inits                   :: [a] -> [[a]]
inits                   = map toListSB . scanl' snocSB emptySB
{-# NOINLINE inits #-}

-- We do not allow inits to inline, because it plays havoc with Call Arity
-- if it fuses with a consumer, and it would generally lead to serious
-- loss of sharing if allowed to fuse with a producer.

-- | \(\mathcal{O}(n)\). The 'tails' function returns all final segments of the
-- argument, longest first. For example,
--
-- >>> tails "abc"
-- ["abc","bc","c",""]
--
-- Note that 'tails' has the following strictness property:
-- @tails _|_ = _|_ : _|_@
tails                   :: [a] -> [[a]]
{-# INLINABLE tails #-}
tails lst               =  build (\c n ->
  let tailsGo xs = xs `c` case xs of
                             []      -> n
                             _ : xs' -> tailsGo xs'
  in tailsGo lst)

-- | The 'subsequences' function returns the list of all subsequences of the argument.
--
-- >>> subsequences "abc"
-- ["","a","b","ab","c","ac","bc","abc"]
--
-- This function is productive on infinite inputs:
--
-- >>> take 8 $ subsequences ['a'..]
-- ["","a","b","ab","c","ac","bc","abc"]
--
-- 'subsequences' does not look ahead unless it must:
--
-- >>> take 1 (subsequences undefined)
-- [[]]
-- >>> take 2 (subsequences ('a' : undefined))
-- ["","a"]
--
subsequences            :: [a] -> [[a]]
subsequences xs         =  [] : nonEmptySubsequences xs

-- | The 'nonEmptySubsequences' function returns the list of all subsequences of the argument,
--   except for the empty list.
--
-- >>> nonEmptySubsequences "abc"
-- ["a","b","ab","c","ac","bc","abc"]
nonEmptySubsequences         :: [a] -> [[a]]
nonEmptySubsequences []      =  []
nonEmptySubsequences (x:xs)  =  [x] : foldr f [] (nonEmptySubsequences xs)
  where f ys r = ys : (x : ys) : r


-- | The 'permutations' function returns the list of all permutations of the argument.
--
-- >>> permutations "abc"
-- ["abc","bac","cba","bca","cab","acb"]
--
-- The 'permutations' function is maximally lazy:
-- for each @n@, the value of @'permutations' xs@ starts with those permutations
-- that permute @'take' n xs@ and keep @'drop' n xs@.
--
-- This function is productive on infinite inputs:
--
-- >>> take 6 $ map (take 3) $ permutations ['a'..]
-- ["abc","bac","cba","bca","cab","acb"]
--
-- Note that the order of permutations is not lexicographic.
-- It satisfies the following property:
--
-- > map (take n) (take (product [1..n]) (permutations ([1..n] ++ undefined))) == permutations [1..n]

GHC's mergesort replaced by a better implementation, 24/12/2009.
This code originally contributed to the nhc12 compiler by Thomas Nordin
in 2002.  Rumoured to have been based on code by Lennart Augustsson, e.g.
    http://www.mail-archive.com/haskell@haskell.org/msg01822.html
and possibly to bear similarities to a 1982 paper by Richard O'Keefe:
"A smooth applicative merge sort".

Benchmarks show it to be often 2x the speed of the previous implementation.

Quicksort replaced by mergesort, 14/5/2002.

From: Ian Lynagh <igloo@earth.li>

I am curious as to why the List.sort implementation in GHC is a
quicksort algorithm rather than an algorithm that guarantees n log n
time in the worst case? I have attached a mergesort implementation along
with a few scripts to time it's performance, the results of which are
shown below (* means it didn't finish successfully - in all cases this
was due to a stack overflow).

If I heap profile the random_list case with only 10000 then I see
random_list peaks at using about 2.5M of memory, whereas in the same
program using List.sort it uses only 100k.

-- Note [INLINE unfoldr]
-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-- We treat unfoldr a little differently from some other forms for list fusion
-- for two reasons:
--
-- 1. We don't want to use a rule to rewrite a basic form to a fusible
-- form because this would inline before constant floating. As Simon Peyton-
-- Jones and others have pointed out, this could reduce sharing in some cases
-- where sharing is beneficial. Thus we simply INLINE it, which is, for
-- example, how enumFromTo::Int becomes eftInt. Unfortunately, we don't seem
-- to get enough of an inlining discount to get a version of eftInt based on
-- unfoldr to inline as readily as the usual one. We know that all the Maybe
-- nonsense will go away, but the compiler does not.
--
-- 2. The benefit of inlining unfoldr is likely to be huge in many common cases,
-- even apart from list fusion. In particular, inlining unfoldr often
-- allows GHC to erase all the Maybes. This appears to be critical if unfoldr
-- is to be used in high-performance code. A small increase in code size

-- Functions on strings

-- | Splits the argument into a list of /lines/ stripped of their terminating
-- @\\n@ characters.  The @\\n@ terminator is optional in a final non-empty
-- line of the argument string.
--
-- For example:
--
-- >>> lines ""           -- empty input contains no lines
-- []
-- >>> lines "\n"         -- single empty line
-- [""]
-- >>> lines "one"        -- single unterminated line
-- ["one"]
-- >>> lines "one\n"      -- single non-empty line
-- ["one"]
-- >>> lines "one\n\n"    -- second line is empty
-- ["one",""]
-- >>> lines "one\ntwo"   -- second line is unterminated
-- ["one","two"]
-- >>> lines "one\ntwo\n" -- two non-empty lines
-- ["one","two"]
--
-- When the argument string is empty, or ends in a @\\n@ character, it can be
-- recovered by passing the result of 'lines' to the 'unlines' function.
-- Otherwise, 'unlines' appends the missing terminating @\\n@.  This makes
-- @unlines . lines@ /idempotent/:
--
-- > (unlines . lines) . (unlines . lines) = (unlines . lines)

{- A "SnocBuilder" is a version of Chris Okasaki's banker's queue that supports
toListSB instead of uncons. In single-threaded use, its performance
characteristics are similar to John Hughes's functional difference lists, but
likely somewhat worse. In heavily persistent settings, however, it does much
better, because it takes advantage of sharing. The banker's queue guarantees
(amortized) O(1) snoc and O(1) uncons, meaning that we can think of toListSB as
an O(1) conversion to a list-like structure a constant factor slower than
normal lists--we pay the O(n) cost incrementally as we consume the list. Using
functional difference lists, on the other hand, we would have to pay the whole
cost up front for each output list. -}

{- We store a front list, a rear list, and the length of the queue.  Because we
only snoc onto the queue and never uncons, we know it's time to rotate when the
length of the queue plus 1 is a power of 2. Note that we rely on the value of
the length field only for performance.  In the unlikely event of overflow, the
performance will suffer but the semantics will remain correct.  -}

data SnocBuilder a = SnocBuilder {-# UNPACK #-} !Word [a] [a]

{- Smart constructor that rotates the builder when lp is one minus a power of
2. Does not rotate very small builders because doing so is not worth the
trouble. The lp < 255 test goes first because the power-of-2 test gives awful
branch prediction for very small n (there are 5 powers of 2 between 1 and
16). Putting the well-predicted lp < 255 test first avoids branching on the
power-of-2 test until powers of 2 have become sufficiently rare to be predicted
well. -}
