~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Suppose we have
  instance {-# OVERLAPPABLE #-} C a where ...
and we are typechecking
  f :: C a => a -> a
  f = e  -- Gives rise to [W] C a

We don't want to solve the wanted constraint with the overlappable
instance; rather we want to use the supplied (C a)! That was the whole
point of it being overlappable!  #14434 wwas an example.

Alas even if the instance has no overlap flag, thus
  instance C a where ...
there is nothing to stop it being overlapped. GHC provides no way to
declare an instance as "final" so it can't be overlapped.  But really
only final instances are OK for short-cut solving.  Sigh. #15135
was a puzzling example.

Note [KnownNat & KnownSymbol and EvLit]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A part of the type-level literals implementation are the classes
"KnownNat" and "KnownSymbol", which provide a "smart" constructor for
defining singleton values.  Here is the key stuff from GHC.TypeNats

  class KnownNat (n :: Nat) where
    natSing :: SNat n

  newtype SNat (n :: Nat) = SNat Natural

Conceptually, this class has infinitely many instances:

  instance KnownNat 0       where natSing = SNat 0
  instance KnownNat 1       where natSing = SNat 1
  instance KnownNat 2       where natSing = SNat 2
  ...

In practice, we solve `KnownNat` predicates in the type-checker
(see GHC.Tc.Solver.Interact) because we can't have infinitely many instances.
The evidence (aka "dictionary") for `KnownNat` is of the form `EvLit (EvNum n)`.

We make the following assumptions about dictionaries in GHC:
  1. The "dictionary" for classes with a single method---like `KnownNat`---is
     a newtype for the type of the method, so using a evidence amounts
     to a coercion, and
  2. Newtypes use the same representation as their definition types.

So, the evidence for `KnownNat` is just a value of the representation type,
wrapped in two newtype constructors: one to make it into a `SNat` value,
and another to make it into a `KnownNat` dictionary.

Also note that `natSing` and `SNat` are never actually exposed from the
library---they are just an implementation detail.  Instead, users see
a more convenient function, defined in terms of `natSing`:

  natVal :: KnownNat n => proxy n -> Natural

The reason we don't use this directly in the class is that it is simpler
and more efficient to pass around a Natural rather than an entire function,
especially when the `KnownNat` evidence is packaged up in an existential.

The story for kind `Symbol` is analogous:
  * class KnownSymbol
  * newtype SSymbol
  * Evidence: a Core literal (e.g. mkNaturalExpr)


Note [Fabricating Evidence for Literals in Backpack]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Let `T` be a type of kind `Nat`. When solving for a purported instance
of `KnownNat T`, ghc tries to resolve the type `T` to an integer `n`,
in which case the evidence `EvLit (EvNum n)` is generated on the
fly. It might appear that this is sufficient as users cannot define
their own instances of `KnownNat`. However, for backpack module this
would not work (see issue #15379). Consider the signature `Abstract`

> signature Abstract where
>   data T :: Nat
>   instance KnownNat T

and a module `Util` that depends on it:

> module Util where
>  import Abstract
>  printT :: IO ()
>  printT = do print $ natVal (Proxy :: Proxy T)

Clearly, we need to "use" the dictionary associated with `KnownNat T`
in the module `Util`, but it is too early for the compiler to produce
a real dictionary as we still have not fixed what `T` is. Only when we
mixin a concrete module

> module Concrete where
>   type T = 42

do we really get hold of the underlying integer. So the strategy that
we follow is the following

1. If T is indeed available as a type alias for an integer constant,
   generate the dictionary on the fly, failing which

2. Look up the type class environment for the evidence.

Finally actual code gets generate for Util only when a module like
Concrete gets "mixed-in" in place of the signature Abstract. As a
result all things, including the typeclass instances, in Concrete gets
reexported. So `KnownNat` gets resolved the normal way post-Backpack.

A similar generation works for `KnownSymbol` as well

Note [withDict]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The class `WithDict` is defined as:

    class WithDict cls meth where
        withDict :: forall {rr :: RuntimeRep} (r :: TYPE rr). meth -> (cls => r) -> r

This class is special, like `Typeable`: GHC automatically solves
for instances of `WithDict`, users cannot write their own.

It is used to implement a primitive that we cannot define in Haskell
but we can write in Core.

`WithDict` is used to create dictionaries for classes with a single method.
Consider a class like this:

   class C a where
     f :: T a

We can use `withDict` to cast values of type `T a` into dictionaries for `C a`.
To do this, we can define a function like this in the library:

  withT :: T a -> (C a => b) -> b
  withT t k = withDict @(C a) @(T a) t k

Here:

* The `cls` in `withDict` is instantiated to `C a`.

* The `meth` in `withDict` is instantiated to `T a`.
  The definition of `T` itself is irrelevant, only that `C a` is a class
  with a single method of type `T a`.

* The `r` in `withDict` is instantiated to `b`.

For any single-method class C:
   class C a1 .. an where op :: meth_ty

The solver will solve the constraint `WithDict (C t1 .. tn) mty`
as if the following instance declaration existed:

instance (mty ~# inst_meth_ty) => WithDict (C t1..tn) mty where
  withDict = \@{rr} @(r :: TYPE rr) (sv :: mty) (k :: C t1..tn => r) ->
    k (sv |> (sub co2 ; sym co))

That is, it matches on the first (constraint) argument of C; if C is
a single-method class, the instance "fires" and emits an equality
constraint `mty ~ inst_meth_ty`, where `inst_meth_ty` is `meth_ty[ti/ai]`.
The coercion `co2` witnesses the equality `mty ~ inst_meth_ty`.

The coercion `co` is a newtype coercion that coerces from `C t1 ... tn`
to `inst_meth_ty`.
This coercion is guaranteed to exist by virtue of the fact that
C is a class with exactly one method and no superclasses, so it
is treated like a newtype when compiled to Core.

The condition that `C` is a single-method class is implemented in the
guards of matchWithDict's definition.
If the conditions are not held, the rewriting will not fire,
and we'll report an unsolved constraint.

Some further observations about `withDict`:

(WD1) The `cls` in the type of withDict must be explicitly instantiated with
      visible type application, as invoking `withDict` would be ambiguous
      otherwise.

      For examples of how `withDict` is used in the `base` library, see `withSNat`
      in GHC.TypeNats, as well as `withSChar` and `withSSymbol` in GHC.TypeLits.

(WD2) The `r` is representation-polymorphic, to support things like
      `withTypeable` in `Data.Typeable.Internal`.

(WD3) As an alternative to `withDict`, one could define functions like `withT`
      above in terms of `unsafeCoerce`. This is more error-prone, however.

(WD4) In order to define things like `withKnownNat` below:

        withKnownNat :: SNat n -> (KnownNat n => r) -> r

      `withDict` needs to be instantiated with `Any`, like so:

        withKnownNat = withDict @(KnownNat Any) @(SNat Any) @r

      The use of `Any` is explained in Note [NOINLINE withSomeSNat] in
      base:GHC.TypeNats.

(WD5) In earlier implementations, `withDict` was implemented as an identifier
      with special handling during either constant-folding or desugaring.
      The current approach is more robust: previously, the type of `withDict`
      did not have a type-class constraint and was overly polymorphic.
      See #19915.

(WD6) In fact, we desugar `withDict @cls @mty @{rr} @r` to

         \@(r :: RuntimeRep) @(a :: TYPE r) (sv :: mty) (k :: cls => a) ->
           k (sv |> (sub co2 ; sym co)))

      That is, we cast the method using a coercion, and apply k to
      it. Moreover, we mark the evidence as incoherent, resulting in
      the use of the 'nospec' magicId (see Note [nospecId magic] in
      GHC.Types.Id.Make) to ensure that the typeclass specialiser
      doesn't incorrectly common-up distinct evidence terms. This is
      super important! Suppose we have calls

          withDict A k
          withDict B k

      where k1, k2 :: C T -> blah.  If we desugared withDict naively, we'd get

          k (A |> co1)
          k (B |> co2)

      and the Specialiser would assume that those arguments (of type `C T`) are
      the same. It would then specialise `k` for that type, and then call the same,
      specialised function from both call sites.  #21575 is a concrete case in point.

      To avoid this, we need to stop the typeclass specialiser from seeing this
      structure, by using nospec. This function is inlined only in CorePrep; crucially
      this means that it still appears in interface files, so that the desugaring of
      withDict remains opaque to the typeclass specialiser across modules.
      This means the specialiser will always see instead:

          nospec @(cls => a) k (A |> co1)
          nospec @(cls => a) k (B |> co2)

      Why does this work? Recall that nospec is not an overloaded function;
      it has the type

        nospec :: forall a. a -> a

      This means that there is nothing for the specialiser to do with function calls
      such as

        nospec @(cls => a) k (A |> co)

      as the specialiser only looks at calls of the form `f dict` for an
      overloaded function `f` (e.g. with a type such as `f :: Eq a => ...`).

      See test-case T21575b.

{- Note [Typeable (T a b c)]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For type applications we always decompose using binary application,
via doTyApp (building a TrApp), until we get to a *kind* instantiation
(building a TrTyCon).  We detect a pure kind instantiation using
`onlyNamedBndrsApplied`.

Example: Proxy :: forall k. k -> *

  To solve Typeable (Proxy @(* -> *) Maybe) we

  - First decompose with doTyApp (onlyNamedBndrsApplied is False)
    to get (Typeable (Proxy @(* -> *))) and Typeable Maybe.
    This step returns a TrApp.

  - Then solve (Typeable (Proxy @(* -> *))) with doTyConApp
    (onlyNamedBndrsApplied is True).
    This step returns a TrTyCon

  So the TypeRep we build is
    TrApp (TrTyCon ("Proxy" @(*->*))) (TrTyCon "Maybe")

Notice also that TYPE and CONSTRAINT are distinct so, in effect, we
allow (Typeable TYPE) and (Typeable CONSTRAINT), giving disinct TypeReps.
This is very important: we may want to get a TypeRep for a kind like
   Type -> Constraint

If we attempt to short-cut by solving it all at once, via
doTyConApp

(this note is sadly truncated FIXME)


Note [No Typeable for polytypes or qualified types]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We do not support impredicative typeable, such as
   Typeable (forall a. a->a)
   Typeable (Eq a => a -> a)
   Typeable (() => Int)
   Typeable (((),()) => Int)

See #9858.  For forall's the case is clear: we simply don't have
a TypeRep for them.  For qualified but not polymorphic types, like
(Eq a => a -> a), things are murkier.  But:

 * We don't need a TypeRep for these things.  TypeReps are for
   monotypes only.

 * Perhaps we could treat `=>` as another type constructor for `Typeable`
   purposes, and thus support things like `Eq Int => Int`, however,
   at the current state of affairs this would be an odd exception as
   no other class works with impredicative types.
   For now we leave it off, until we have a better story for impredicativity.


Note [Typeable for Nat and Symbol]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We have special Typeable instances for Nat and Symbol.  Roughly we
have this instance, implemented here by doTyLit:
      instance KnownNat n => Typeable (n :: Nat) where
         typeRep = typeNatTypeRep @n
where
   Data.Typeable.Internal.typeNatTypeRep :: KnownNat a => TypeRep a

Ultimately typeNatTypeRep uses 'natSing' from KnownNat to get a
runtime value 'n'; it turns it into a string with 'show' and uses
that to whiz up a TypeRep TyCon for 'n', with mkTypeLitTyCon.
See #10348.

Because of this rule it's inadvisable (see #15322) to have a constraint
    f :: (Typeable (n :: Nat)) => blah
in a function signature; it gives rise to overlap problems just as
if you'd written
    f :: Eq [a] => blah

{-
Note [HasField instances]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Suppose we have

    data T y = MkT { foo :: [y] }

and `foo` is in scope.  Then GHC will automatically solve a constraint like

    HasField "foo" (T Int) b

by emitting a new wanted

    T alpha -> [alpha] ~# T Int -> b

and building a HasField dictionary out of the selector function `foo`,
appropriately cast.

The HasField class is defined (in GHC.Records) thus:

    class HasField (x :: k) r a | x r -> a where
      getField :: r -> a

Since this is a one-method class, it is represented as a newtype.
Hence we can solve `HasField "foo" (T Int) b` by taking an expression
of type `T Int -> b` and casting it using the newtype coercion.
Note that

    foo :: forall y . T y -> [y]

so the expression we construct is

    foo @alpha |> co

where

    co :: (T alpha -> [alpha]) ~# HasField "foo" (T Int) b

is built from

    co1 :: (T alpha -> [alpha]) ~# (T Int -> b)

which is the new wanted, and

    co2 :: (T Int -> b) ~# HasField "foo" (T Int) b

which can be derived from the newtype coercion.

If `foo` is not in scope, or has a higher-rank or existentially
quantified type, then the constraint is not solved automatically, but
may be solved by a user-supplied HasField instance.  Similarly, if we
encounter a HasField constraint where the field is not a literal
string, or does not belong to the type, then we fall back on the
normal constraint solver behaviour.


Note [Unused name reporting and HasField]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When a HasField constraint is solved by the type-checker, we must record a use
of the corresponding field name, as otherwise it might be reported as unused.
See #19213.  We need to call keepAlive to add the name to the tcg_keep set,
which accumulates names used by the constraint solver, as described by
Note [Tracking unused binding and imports] in GHC.Tc.Types.

We need to call addUsedGRE as well because there may be a deprecation warning on
the field, which will be reported by addUsedGRE.  But calling addUsedGRE without
keepAlive is not enough, because the field might be defined locally, and
addUsedGRE extends tcg_used_gres with imported GREs only.
