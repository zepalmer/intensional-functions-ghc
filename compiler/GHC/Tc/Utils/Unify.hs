{- Note [matchActualFunTy error handling]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
matchActualFunTySigma is made much more complicated by the
desire to produce good error messages. Consider the application
    f @Int x y
In GHC.Tc.Gen.Expr.tcArgs we deal with visible type arguments,
and then call matchActualFunTysPart for each individual value
argument. It, in turn, must instantiate any type/dictionary args,
before looking for an arrow type.

But if it doesn't find an arrow type, it wants to generate a message
like "f is applied to two arguments but its type only has one".
To do that, it needs to know about the args that tcArgs has already
munched up -- hence passing in n_val_args_in_call and arg_tys_so_far;
and hence also the accumulating so_far arg to 'go'.

This allows us (in mk_ctxt) to construct f's /instantiated/ type,
with just the values-arg arrows, which is what we really want
in the error message.

Ugh!

Note [Herald for matchExpectedFunTys]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The 'herald' always looks like:
   "The equation(s) for 'f' have"
   "The abstraction (\x.e) takes"
   "The section (+ x) expects"
   "The function 'f' is applied to"

This is used to construct a message of form

   The abstraction `\Just 1 -> ...' takes two arguments
   but its type `Maybe a -> a' has only one

   The equation(s) for `f' have two arguments
   but its type `Maybe a -> a' has only one

   The section `(f 3)' requires 'f' to take two arguments
   but its type `Int -> Int' has only one

   The function 'f' is applied to two arguments
   but its type `Int -> Int' has only one

When visible type applications (e.g., `f @Int 1 2`, as in #13902) enter the
picture, we have a choice in deciding whether to count the type applications as
proper arguments:

   The function 'f' is applied to one visible type argument
     and two value arguments
   but its type `forall a. a -> a` has only one visible type argument
     and one value argument

Or whether to include the type applications as part of the herald itself:

   The expression 'f @Int' is applied to two arguments
   but its type `Int -> Int` has only one

The latter is easier to implement and is arguably easier to understand, so we
choose to implement that option.

Note [matchExpectedFunTys]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
matchExpectedFunTys checks that a sigma has the form
of an n-ary function.  It passes the decomposed type to the
thing_inside, and returns a wrapper to coerce between the two types

It's used wherever a language construct must have a functional type,
namely:
        A lambda expression
        A function definition
     An operator section

This function must be written CPS'd because it needs to fill in the
ExpTypes produced for arguments before it can fill in the ExpType
passed in.

Note [Return arguments with a fixed RuntimeRep]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The functions

  - matchExpectedFunTys,
  - matchActualFunTySigma,
  - matchActualFunTysRho,

peel off argument types, as explained in Note [matchExpectedFunTys].
It's important that these functions return argument types that have
a fixed runtime representation, otherwise we would be in violation
of the representation-polymorphism invariants of
Note [Representation polymorphism invariants] in GHC.Core.

This is why all these functions have an additional invariant,
that the argument types they return all have a syntactically fixed RuntimeRep,
in the sense of Note [Fixed RuntimeRep] in GHC.Tc.Utils.Concrete.

Example:

  Suppose we have

    type F :: Type -> RuntimeRep
    type family F a where { F Int = LiftedRep }

    type Dual :: Type -> Type
    type family Dual a where
      Dual a = a -> ()

    f :: forall (a :: TYPE (F Int)). Dual a
    f = \ x -> ()

  The body of `f` is a lambda abstraction, so we must be able to split off
  one argument type from its type. This is handled by `matchExpectedFunTys`
  (see 'GHC.Tc.Gen.Match.tcMatchLambda'). We end up with desugared Core that
  looks like this:

    f :: forall (a :: TYPE (F Int)). Dual (a |> (TYPE F[0]))
    f = \ @(a :: TYPE (F Int)) ->
          (\ (x :: (a |> (TYPE F[0]))) -> ())
          `cast`
          (Sub (Sym (Dual[0] <(a |> (TYPE F[0]))>)))

  Two important transformations took place:

    1. We inserted casts around the argument type to ensure that it has
       a fixed runtime representation, as required by invariant (I1) from
       Note [Representation polymorphism invariants] in GHC.Core.
    2. We inserted a cast around the whole lambda to make everything line up
       with the type signature.

{- Note [fillInferResult]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When inferring, we use fillInferResult to "fill in" the hole in InferResult
   data InferResult = IR { ir_uniq :: Unique
                         , ir_lvl  :: TcLevel
                         , ir_ref  :: IORef (Maybe TcType) }

There are two things to worry about:

1. What if it is under a GADT or existential pattern match?
   - GADTs: a unification variable (and Infer's hole is similar) is untouchable
   - Existentials: be careful about skolem-escape

2. What if it is filled in more than once?  E.g. multiple branches of a case
     case e of
        T1 -> e1
        T2 -> e2

Our typing rules are:

* The RHS of a existential or GADT alternative must always be a
  monotype, regardless of the number of alternatives.

* Multiple non-existential/GADT branches can have (the same)
  higher rank type (#18412).  E.g. this is OK:
      case e of
        True  -> hr
        False -> hr
  where hr:: (forall a. a->a) -> Int
  c.f. Section 7.1 of "Practical type inference for arbitrary-rank types"
       We use choice (2) in that Section.
       (GHC 8.10 and earlier used choice (1).)

  But note that
      case e of
        True  -> hr
        False -> \x -> hr x
  will fail, because we still /infer/ both branches, so the \x will get
  a (monotype) unification variable, which will fail to unify with
  (forall a. a->a)

For (1) we can detect the GADT/existential situation by seeing that
the current TcLevel is greater than that stored in ir_lvl of the Infer
ExpType.  We bump the level whenever we go past a GADT/existential match.

Then, before filling the hole use promoteTcType to promote the type
to the outer ir_lvl.  promoteTcType does this
  - create a fresh unification variable alpha at level ir_lvl
  - emits an equality alpha[ir_lvl] ~ ty
  - fills the hole with alpha
That forces the type to be a monotype (since unification variables can
only unify with monotypes); and catches skolem-escapes because the
alpha is untouchable until the equality floats out.

For (2), we simply look to see if the hole is filled already.
  - if not, we promote (as above) and fill the hole
  - if it is filled, we simply unify with the type that is
    already there

There is one wrinkle.  Suppose we have
   case e of
      T1 -> e1 :: (forall a. a->a) -> Int
      G2 -> e2
where T1 is not GADT or existential, but G2 is a GADT.  Then suppose the
T1 alternative fills the hole with (forall a. a->a) -> Int, which is fine.
But now the G2 alternative must not *just* unify with that else we'd risk
allowing through (e2 :: (forall a. a->a) -> Int).  If we'd checked G2 first
we'd have filled the hole with a unification variable, which enforces a
monotype.

So if we check G2 second, we still want to emit a constraint that restricts
the RHS to be a monotype. This is done by ensureMonoType, and it works
by simply generating a constraint (alpha ~ ty), where alpha is a fresh
unification variable.  We discard the evidence.

Note [Subsumption checking: tcSubType]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
All the tcSubType calls have the form
                tcSubType actual_ty expected_ty
which checks
                actual_ty <= expected_ty

That is, that a value of type actual_ty is acceptable in
a place expecting a value of type expected_ty.  I.e. that

    actual ty   is more polymorphic than   expected_ty

It returns a wrapper function
        co_fn :: actual_ty ~ expected_ty
which takes an HsExpr of type actual_ty into one of type
expected_ty.

Note [Ambiguity check and deep subsumption]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Consider
   f :: (forall b. Eq b => a -> a) -> Int

Does `f` have an ambiguous type?   The ambiguity check usually checks
that this definition of f' would typecheck, where f' has the exact same
type as f:
   f' :: (forall b. Eq b => a -> a) -> Intp
   f' = f

This will be /rejected/ with DeepSubsumption but /accepted/ with
ShallowSubsumption.  On the other hand, this eta-expanded version f''
would be rejected both ways:
   f'' :: (forall b. Eq b => a -> a) -> Intp
   f'' x = f x

This is squishy in the same way as other examples in GHC.Tc.Validity
Note [The squishiness of the ambiguity check]

The situation in June 2022.  Since we have SimpleSubsumption at the moment,
we don't want introduce new breakage if you add -XDeepSubsumption, by
rejecting types as ambiguous that weren't ambiguous before.  So, as a
holding decision, we /always/ use SimpleSubsumption for the ambiguity check
(erring on the side accepting more programs). Hence tcSubTypeAmbiguity.

{- Note [Instantiation of InferResult]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We now always instantiate before filling in InferResult, so that
the result is a TcRhoType: see #17173 for discussion.

For example:

1. Consider
    f x = (*)
   We want to instantiate the type of (*) before returning, else we
   will infer the type
     f :: forall {a}. a -> forall b. Num b => b -> b -> b
   This is surely confusing for users.

   And worse, the monomorphism restriction won't work properly. The MR is
   dealt with in simplifyInfer, and simplifyInfer has no way of
   instantiating. This could perhaps be worked around, but it may be
   hard to know even when instantiation should happen.

2. Another reason.  Consider
       f :: (?x :: Int) => a -> a
       g y = let ?x = 3::Int in f
   Here want to instantiate f's type so that the ?x::Int constraint
  gets discharged by the enclosing implicit-parameter binding.

3. Suppose one defines plus = (+). If we instantiate lazily, we will
   infer plus :: forall a. Num a => a -> a -> a. However, the monomorphism
   restriction compels us to infer
      plus :: Integer -> Integer -> Integer
   (or similar monotype). Indeed, the only way to know whether to apply
   the monomorphism restriction at all is to instantiate

There is one place where we don't want to instantiate eagerly,
namely in GHC.Tc.Module.tcRnExpr, which implements GHCi's :type
command. See Note [Implementing :type] in GHC.Tc.Module.

{- Note [Don't skolemise unnecessarily]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Suppose we are trying to solve
     ty_actual   <= ty_expected
    (Char->Char) <= (forall a. a->a)
We could skolemise the 'forall a', and then complain
that (Char ~ a) is insoluble; but that's a pretty obscure
error.  It's better to say that
    (Char->Char) ~ (forall a. a->a)
fails.

If we prematurely go to equality we'll reject a program we should
accept (e.g. #13752).  So the test (which is only to improve error
message) is very conservative:

 * ty_actual   is /definitely/ monomorphic: see `definitely_mono`
   This definitely_mono test comes in "shallow" and "deep" variants

 * ty_expected is /definitely/ polymorphic: see `definitely_poly`
   This definitely_poly test is more subtle than you might think.
   Here are three cases where expected_ty looks polymorphic, but
   isn't, and where it would be /wrong/ to switch to equality:

   (DP1)  (Char->Char) <= (forall a. (a~Char) => a -> a)

   (DP2)  (Char->Char) <= (forall a. Char -> Char)

   (DP3)  (Char->Char) <= (forall a. F [a] Char -> Char)
                          where type instance F [x] t = t


Note [Wrapper returned from tcSubMult]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There is no notion of multiplicity coercion in Core, therefore the wrapper
returned by tcSubMult (and derived functions such as tcCheckUsage and
checkManyPattern) is quite unlike any other wrapper: it checks whether the
coercion produced by the constraint solver is trivial, producing a type error
if it is not. This is implemented via the WpMultCoercion wrapper, as desugared
by GHC.HsToCore.Binds.dsHsWrapper, which does the reflexivity check.

This wrapper needs to be placed in the term; otherwise, checking of the
eventual coercion won't be triggered during desugaring. But it can be put
anywhere, since it doesn't affect the desugared code.

Why do we check this in the desugarer? It's a convenient place, since it's
right after all the constraints are solved. We need the constraints to be
solved to check whether they are trivial or not.

An alternative would be to have a kind of constraint which can
only produce trivial evidence. This would allow such checks to happen
in the constraint solver (#18756).
This would be similar to the existing setup for Concrete, see
  Note [The Concrete mechanism] in GHC.Tc.Utils.Concrete
    (PHASE 1 in particular).

{- Note [Deep subsumption]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The DeepSubsumption extension, documented here

    https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/pull/511.

makes a best-efforts attempt implement deep subsumption as it was
prior to the Simplify Subsumption proposal:

    https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/pull/287

The effects are in these main places:

1. In the subsumption check, tcSubType, we must do deep skolemisation:
   see the call to tcDeeplySkolemise in tc_sub_type_deep

2. In tcPolyExpr we must do deep skolemisation:
   see the call to tcDeeplySkolemise in tcSkolemiseExpType

3. for expression type signatures (e :: ty), and functions with type
   signatures (e.g. f :: ty; f = e), we must deeply skolemise the type;
   see the call to tcDeeplySkolemise in tcSkolemiseScoped.

4. In GHC.Tc.Gen.App.tcApp we call tcSubTypeDS to match the result
   type. Without deep subsumption, unifyExpectedType would be sufficent.

In all these cases note that the deep skolemisation must be done /first/.
Consider (1)
     (forall a. Int -> a -> a)  <=  Int -> (forall b. b -> b)
We must skolemise the `forall b` before instantiating the `forall a`.
See also Note [Deep skolemisation].

Note that we /always/ use shallow subsumption in the ambiguity check.
See Note [Ambiguity check and deep subsumption].

Note [Deep skolemisation]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
deeplySkolemise decomposes and skolemises a type, returning a type
with all its arrows visible (ie not buried under foralls)

Examples:

  deeplySkolemise (Int -> forall a. Ord a => blah)
    =  ( wp, [a], [d:Ord a], Int -> blah )
    where wp = \x:Int. /\a. \(d:Ord a). <hole> x

  deeplySkolemise  (forall a. Ord a => Maybe a -> forall b. Eq b => blah)
    =  ( wp, [a,b], [d1:Ord a,d2:Eq b], Maybe a -> blah )
    where wp = /\a.\(d1:Ord a).\(x:Maybe a)./\b.\(d2:Ord b). <hole> x

In general,
  if      deeplySkolemise ty = (wrap, tvs, evs, rho)
    and   e :: rho
  then    wrap e :: ty
    and   'wrap' binds tvs, evs

ToDo: this eta-abstraction plays fast and loose with termination,
      because it can introduce extra lambdas.  Maybe add a `seq` to
      fix this

Note [Setting the argument context]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Consider we are doing the ambiguity check for the (bogus)
  f :: (forall a b. C b => a -> a) -> Int

We'll call
   tcSubType ((forall a b. C b => a->a) -> Int )
             ((forall a b. C b => a->a) -> Int )

with a UserTypeCtxt of (FunSigCtxt "f").  Then we'll do the co/contra thing
on the argument type of the (->) -- and at that point we want to switch
to a UserTypeCtxt of GenSigCtxt.  Why?

* Error messages.  If we stick with FunSigCtxt we get errors like
     * Could not deduce: C b
       from the context: C b0
        bound by the type signature for:
            f :: forall a b. C b => a->a
  But of course f does not have that type signature!
  Example tests: T10508, T7220a, Simple14

* Implications. We may decide to build an implication for the whole
  ambiguity check, but we don't need one for each level within it,
  and TcUnify.alwaysBuildImplication checks the UserTypeCtxt.
  See Note [When to build an implication]

Note [Multiplicity in deep subsumption]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Consider
   t1 ->{mt} t2  <=   s1 ->{ms} s2

At the moment we /unify/ ms~mt, via tcEqMult.

Arguably we should use `tcSubMult`. But then if mt=m0 (a unification
variable) and ms=Many, `tcSubMult` is a no-op (since anything is a
sub-multiplicty of Many).  But then `m0` may never get unified with
anything.  It is then skolemised by the zonker; see GHC.HsToCore.Binds
Note [Free tyvars on rule LHS].  So we in RULE foldr/app in GHC.Base
we get this

 "foldr/app"     [1] forall ys m1 m2. foldr (\x{m1} \xs{m2}. (:) x xs) ys
                                       = \xs -> xs ++ ys

where we eta-expanded that (:).  But now foldr expects an argument
with ->{Many} and gets an argument with ->{m1} or ->{m2}, and Lint
complains.

The easiest solution was to use tcEqMult in tc_sub_type_ds, and
insist on equality. This is only in the DeepSubsumption code anyway.

{- Note [Skolemisation]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
tcTopSkolemise takes "expected type" and strip off quantifiers to expose the
type underneath, binding the new skolems for the 'thing_inside'
The returned 'HsWrapper' has type (specific_ty -> expected_ty).

Note that for a nested type like
   forall a. Eq a => forall b. Ord b => blah
we still only build one implication constraint
   forall a b. (Eq a, Ord b) => <constraints>
This is just an optimisation, but it's why we use topSkolemise to
build the pieces from all the layers, before making a single call
to checkConstraints.

tcSkolemiseScoped is very similar, but differs in two ways:

* It deals specially with just the outer forall, bringing those type
  variables into lexical scope.  To my surprise, I found that doing
  this unconditionally in tcTopSkolemise (i.e. doing it even if we don't
  need to bring the variables into lexical scope, which is harmless)
  caused a non-trivial (1%-ish) perf hit on the compiler.

* It handles deep subumption, wheres tcTopSkolemise never looks under
  function arrows.

* It always calls checkConstraints, even if there are no skolem
  variables at all.  Reason: there might be nested deferred errors
  that must not be allowed to float to top level.

{- Note [When to build an implication]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Suppose we have some 'skolems' and some 'givens', and we are
considering whether to wrap the constraints in their scope into an
implication.  We must /always/ so if either 'skolems' or 'givens' are
non-empty.  But what if both are empty?  You might think we could
always drop the implication.  Other things being equal, the fewer
implications the better.  Less clutter and overhead.  But we must
take care:

* If we have an unsolved [W] g :: a ~# b, and -fdefer-type-errors,
  we'll make a /term-level/ evidence binding for 'g = error "blah"'.
  We must have an EvBindsVar those bindings!, otherwise they end up as
  top-level unlifted bindings, which are verboten. This only matters
  at top level, so we check for that
  See also Note [Deferred errors for coercion holes] in GHC.Tc.Errors.
  cf #14149 for an example of what goes wrong.

* If you have
     f :: Int;  f = f_blah
     g :: Bool; g = g_blah
  If we don't build an implication for f or g (no tyvars, no givens),
  the constraints for f_blah and g_blah are solved together.  And that
  can yield /very/ confusing error messages, because we can get
      [W] C Int b1    -- from f_blah
      [W] C Int b2    -- from g_blan
  and fundpes can yield [W] b1 ~ b2, even though the two functions have
  literally nothing to do with each other.  #14185 is an example.
  Building an implication keeps them separate.

{- Note [Check for equality before deferring]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Particularly in ambiguity checks we can get equalities like (ty ~ ty).
If ty involves a type function we may defer, which isn't very sensible.
An egregious example of this was in test T9872a, which has a type signature
       Proxy :: Proxy (Solutions Cubes)
Doing the ambiguity check on this signature generates the equality
   Solutions Cubes ~ Solutions Cubes
and currently the constraint solver normalises both sides at vast cost.
This little short-cut in 'defer' helps quite a bit.

Note [Care with type applications]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Note: type applications need a bit of care!
They can match FunTy and TyConApp, so use splitAppTy_maybe
NB: we've already dealt with type variables and Notes,
so if one type is an App the other one jolly well better be too

Note [Mismatched type lists and application decomposition]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When we find two TyConApps, you might think that the argument lists
are guaranteed equal length.  But they aren't. Consider matching
        w (T x) ~ Foo (T x y)
We do match (w ~ Foo) first, but in some circumstances we simply create
a deferred constraint; and then go ahead and match (T x ~ T x y).
This came up in #3950.

So either
   (a) either we must check for identical argument kinds
       when decomposing applications,

   (b) or we must be prepared for ill-kinded unification sub-problems

Currently we adopt (b) since it seems more robust -- no need to maintain
a global invariant.

Note [Expanding synonyms during unification]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We expand synonyms during unification, but:
 * We expand *after* the variable case so that we tend to unify
   variables with un-expanded type synonym. This just makes it
   more likely that the inferred types will mention type synonyms
   understandable to the user

 * Similarly, we expand *after* the CastTy case, just in case the
   CastTy wraps a variable.

 * We expand *before* the TyConApp case.  For example, if we have
      type Phantom a = Int
   and are unifying
      Phantom Int ~ Phantom Char
   it is *wrong* to unify Int and Char.

 * The problem case immediately above can happen only with arguments
   to the tycon. So we check for nullary tycons *before* expanding.
   This is particularly helpful when checking (* ~ *), because * is
   now a type synonym.

Note [Deferred unification]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We may encounter a unification ty1 ~ ty2 that cannot be performed syntactically,
and yet its consistency is undetermined. Previously, there was no way to still
make it consistent. So a mismatch error was issued.

Now these unifications are deferred until constraint simplification, where type
family instances and given equations may (or may not) establish the consistency.
Deferred unifications are of the form
                F ... ~ ...
or              x ~ ...
where F is a type function and x is a type variable.
E.g.
        id :: x ~ y => x -> y
        id e = e

involves the unification x = y. It is deferred until we bring into account the
context x ~ y to establish that it holds.

If available, we defer original types (rather than those where closed type
synonyms have already been expanded via tcCoreView).  This is, as usual, to
improve error messages.

{- Note [Unification preconditions]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Question: given a homogeneous equality (alpha ~# ty), when is it OK to
unify alpha := ty?

This note only applied to /homogeneous/ equalities, in which both
sides have the same kind.

There are five reasons not to unify:

1. (SKOL-ESC) Skolem-escape
   Consider the constraint
        forall[2] a[2]. alpha[1] ~ Maybe a[2]
   If we unify alpha := Maybe a, the skolem 'a' may escape its scope.
   The level alpha[1] says that alpha may be used outside this constraint,
   where 'a' is not in scope at all.  So we must not unify.

   Bottom line: when looking at a constraint alpha[n] := ty, do not unify
   if any free variable of 'ty' has level deeper (greater) than n

2. (UNTOUCHABLE) Untouchable unification variables
   Consider the constraint
        forall[2] a[2]. b[1] ~ Int => alpha[1] ~ Int
   There is no (SKOL-ESC) problem with unifying alpha := Int, but it might
   not be the principal solution. Perhaps the "right" solution is alpha := b.
   We simply can't tell.  See "OutsideIn(X): modular type inference with local
   assumptions", section 2.2.  We say that alpha[1] is "untouchable" inside
   this implication.

   Bottom line: at ambient level 'l', when looking at a constraint
   alpha[n] ~ ty, do not unify alpha := ty if there are any given equalities
   between levels 'n' and 'l'.

   Exactly what is a "given equality" for the purpose of (UNTOUCHABLE)?
   Answer: see Note [Tracking Given equalities] in GHC.Tc.Solver.InertSet

3. (TYVAR-TV) Unifying TyVarTvs and CycleBreakerTvs
   This precondition looks at the MetaInfo of the unification variable:

   * TyVarTv: When considering alpha{tyv} ~ ty, if alpha{tyv} is a
     TyVarTv it can only unify with a type variable, not with a
     structured type.  So if 'ty' is a structured type, such as (Maybe x),
     don't unify.

   * CycleBreakerTv: never unified, except by restoreTyVarCycles.

4. (CONCRETE) A ConcreteTv can only unify with a concrete type,
    by definition.

    That is, if we have `rr[conc] ~ F Int`, we can't unify
    `rr` with `F Int`, so we hold off on unifying.
    Note however that the equality might get rewritten; for instance
    if we can rewrite `F Int` to a concrete type, say `FloatRep`,
    then we will have `rr[conc] ~ FloatRep` and we can unify `rr ~ FloatRep`.

    Note that we can still make progress on unification even if
    we can't fully solve an equality, e.g.

      alpha[conc] ~# TupleRep '[ beta[tau], F gamma[tau] ]

    we can fill beta[tau] := beta[conc]. This is why we call
    'makeTypeConcrete' in startSolvingByUnification.

5. (COERCION-HOLE) Confusing coercion holes
   Suppose our equality is
     (alpha :: k) ~ (Int |> {co})
   where co :: Type ~ k is an unsolved wanted. Note that this
   equality is homogeneous; both sides have kind k. Unifying here
   is sensible, but it can lead to very confusing error messages.
   It's very much like a Wanted rewriting a Wanted. Even worse,
   unifying a variable essentially turns an equality into a Given,
   and so we could not use the tracking mechanism in
   Note [Wanteds rewrite Wanteds] in GHC.Tc.Types.Constraint.
   We thus simply do not unify in this case.

   This is expanded as Wrinkle (2) in Note [Equalities with incompatible kinds]
   in GHC.Tc.Solver.Canonical.


Needless to say, all there are wrinkles:

* (SKOL-ESC) Promotion.  Given alpha[n] ~ ty, what if beta[k] is free
  in 'ty', where beta is a unification variable, and k>n?  'beta'
  stands for a monotype, and since it is part of a level-n type
  (equal to alpha[n]), we must /promote/ beta to level n.  Just make
  up a fresh gamma[n], and unify beta[k] := gamma[n].

* (TYVAR-TV) Unification variables.  Suppose alpha[tyv,n] is a level-n
  TyVarTv (see Note [TyVarTv] in GHC.Tc.Types.TcMType)? Now
  consider alpha[tyv,n] ~ Bool.  We don't want to unify because that
  would break the TyVarTv invariant.

  What about alpha[tyv,n] ~ beta[tau,n], where beta is an ordinary
  TauTv?  Again, don't unify, because beta might later be unified
  with, say Bool.  (If levels permit, we reverse the orientation here;
  see Note [TyVar/TyVar orientation].)

* (UNTOUCHABLE) Untouchability.  When considering (alpha[n] ~ ty), how
  do we know whether there are any given equalities between level n
  and the ambient level?  We answer in two ways:

  * In the eager unifier, we only unify if l=n.  If not, alpha may be
    untouchable, and defer to the constraint solver.  This check is
    made in GHC.Tc.Utils.uUnifilledVar2, in the guard
    isTouchableMetaTyVar.

  * In the constraint solver, we track where Given equalities occur
    and use that to guard unification in GHC.Tc.Solver.Canonical.touchabilityTest
    More details in Note [Tracking Given equalities] in GHC.Tc.Solver.InertSet

    Historical note: in the olden days (pre 2021) the constraint solver
    also used to unify only if l=n.  Equalities were "floated" out of the
    implication in a separate step, so that they would become touchable.
    But the float/don't-float question turned out to be very delicate,
    as you can see if you look at the long series of Notes associated with
    GHC.Tc.Solver.floatEqualities, around Nov 2020.  It's much easier
    to unify in-place, with no floating.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
See also Note [Fundeps with instances, and equality orientation]
where the kind equality orientation is important

Given (a ~ b), should we orient the CEqCan as (a~b) or (b~a)?
This is a surprisingly tricky question! This is invariant (TyEq:TV).

The question is answered by swapOverTyVars, which is used
  - in the eager unifier, in GHC.Tc.Utils.Unify.uUnfilledVar1
  - in the constraint solver, in GHC.Tc.Solver.Canonical.canEqCanLHS2

First note: only swap if you have to!

So we look for a positive reason to swap, using a three-step test:

* Level comparison. If 'a' has deeper level than 'b',
  put 'a' on the left.  See Note [Deeper level on the left]

* Priority.  If the levels are the same, look at what kind of
  type variable it is, using 'lhsPriority'.

  Generally speaking we always try to put a MetaTv on the left
  in preference to SkolemTv or RuntimeUnkTv:
     a) Because the MetaTv may be touchable and can be unified
     b) Even if it's not touchable, GHC.Tc.Solver.floatConstraints
        looks for meta tyvars on the left

  Tie-breaking rules for MetaTvs:
  - CycleBreakerTv: This is essentially a stand-in for another type;
       it's untouchable and should have the same priority as a skolem: 0.

  - TyVarTv: These can unify only with another tyvar, but we can't unify
       a TyVarTv with a TauTv, because then the TyVarTv could (transitively)
       get a non-tyvar type. So give these a low priority: 1.

  - ConcreteTv: These are like TauTv, except they can only unify with
    a concrete type. So we want to be able to write to them, but not quite
    as much as TauTvs: 2.

  - TauTv: This is the common case; we want these on the left so that they
       can be written to: 3.

  - RuntimeUnkTv: These aren't really meta-variables used in type inference,
       but just a convenience in the implementation of the GHCi debugger.
       Eagerly write to these: 4. See Note [RuntimeUnkTv] in
       GHC.Runtime.Heap.Inspect.

* Names. If the level and priority comparisons are all
  equal, try to eliminate a TyVar with a System Name in
  favour of ones with a Name derived from a user type signature

* Age.  At one point in the past we tried to break any remaining
  ties by eliminating the younger type variable, based on their
  Uniques.  See Note [Eliminate younger unification variables]
  (which also explains why we don't do this any more)

Note [Unification variables on the left]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
For wanteds, but not givens, swap (skolem ~ meta-tv) regardless of
level, so that the unification variable is on the left.

* We /don't/ want this for Givens because if we ave
    [G] a[2] ~ alpha[1]
    [W] Bool ~ a[2]
  we want to rewrite the wanted to Bool ~ alpha[1],
  so we can float the constraint and solve it.

* But for Wanteds putting the unification variable on
  the left means an easier job when floating, and when
  reporting errors -- just fewer cases to consider.

  In particular, we get better skolem-escape messages:
  see #18114

Note [Deeper level on the left]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The most important thing is that we want to put tyvars with
the deepest level on the left.  The reason to do so differs for
Wanteds and Givens, but either way, deepest wins!  Simple.

* Wanteds.  Putting the deepest variable on the left maximise the
  chances that it's a touchable meta-tyvar which can be solved.

* Givens. Suppose we have something like
     forall a[2]. b[1] ~ a[2] => beta[1] ~ a[2]

  If we orient the Given a[2] on the left, we'll rewrite the Wanted to
  (beta[1] ~ b[1]), and that can float out of the implication.
  Otherwise it can't.  By putting the deepest variable on the left
  we maximise our changes of eliminating skolem capture.

  See also GHC.Tc.Solver.InertSet Note [Let-bound skolems] for another reason
  to orient with the deepest skolem on the left.

  IMPORTANT NOTE: this test does a level-number comparison on
  skolems, so it's important that skolems have (accurate) level
  numbers.

See #15009 for an further analysis of why "deepest on the left"
is a good plan.

Note [Avoid unnecessary swaps]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If we swap without actually improving matters, we can get an infinite loop.
Consider
    work item:  a ~ b
   inert item:  b ~ c
We canonicalise the work-item to (a ~ c).  If we then swap it before
adding to the inert set, we'll add (c ~ a), and therefore kick out the
inert guy, so we get
   new work item:  b ~ c
   inert item:     c ~ a
And now the cycle just repeats

Historical Note [Eliminate younger unification variables]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Given a choice of unifying
     alpha := beta   or   beta := alpha
we try, if possible, to eliminate the "younger" one, as determined
by `ltUnique`.  Reason: the younger one is less likely to appear free in
an existing inert constraint, and hence we are less likely to be forced
into kicking out and rewriting inert constraints.

This is a performance optimisation only.  It turns out to fix
#14723 all by itself, but clearly not reliably so!

It's simple to implement (see nicer_to_update_tv2 in swapOverTyVars).
But, to my surprise, it didn't seem to make any significant difference
to the compiler's performance, so I didn't take it any further.  Still
it seemed too nice to discard altogether, so I'm leaving these
notes.  SLPJ Jan 18.

Note [Prevent unification with type families]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We prevent unification with type families because of an uneasy compromise.
It's perfectly sound to unify with type families, and it even improves the
error messages in the testsuite. It also modestly improves performance, at
least in some cases. But it's disastrous for test case perf/compiler/T3064.
Here is the problem: Suppose we have (F ty) where we also have [G] F ty ~ a.
What do we do? Do we reduce F? Or do we use the given? Hard to know what's
best. GHC reduces. This is a disaster for T3064, where the type's size
spirals out of control during reduction. If we prevent
unification with type families, then the solver happens to use the equality
before expanding the type family.

It would be lovely in the future to revisit this problem and remove this
extra, unnecessary check. But we retain it for now as it seems to work
better in practice.

Revisited in Nov '20, along with removing flattening variables. Problem
is still present, and the solution is still the same.

Note [Type synonyms and the occur check]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Generally speaking we try to update a variable with type synonyms not
expanded, which improves later error messages, unless looking
inside a type synonym may help resolve a spurious occurs check
error. Consider:
          type A a = ()

          f :: (A a -> a -> ()) -> ()
          f = \ _ -> ()

          x :: ()
          x = f (\ x p -> p x)

We will eventually get a constraint of the form t ~ A t. The ok function above will
properly expand the type (A t) to just (), which is ok to be unified with t. If we had
unified with the original type A t, we would lead the type checker into an infinite loop.

Hence, if the occurs check fails for a type synonym application, then (and *only* then),
the ok function expands the synonym to detect opportunities for occurs check success using
the underlying definition of the type synonym.

The same applies later on in the constraint interaction code; see GHC.Tc.Solver.Interact,
function @occ_check_ok@.

Note [Non-TcTyVars in GHC.Tc.Utils.Unify]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Because the same code is now shared between unifying types and unifying
kinds, we sometimes will see proper TyVars floating around the unifier.
Example (from test case polykinds/PolyKinds12):

    type family Apply (f :: k1 -> k2) (x :: k1) :: k2
    type instance Apply g y = g y

When checking the instance declaration, we first *kind-check* the LHS
and RHS, discovering that the instance really should be

    type instance Apply k3 k4 (g :: k3 -> k4) (y :: k3) = g y

During this kind-checking, all the tyvars will be TcTyVars. Then, however,
as a second pass, we desugar the RHS (which is done in functions prefixed
with "tc" in GHC.Tc.TyCl"). By this time, all the kind-vars are proper
TyVars, not TcTyVars, get some kind unification must happen.

Thus, we always check if a TyVar is a TcTyVar before asking if it's a
meta-tyvar.

This used to not be necessary for type-checking (that is, before * :: *)
because expressions get desugared via an algorithm separate from
type-checking (with wrappers, etc.). Types get desugared very differently,
causing this wibble in behavior seen here.

{-  Note [Checking for foralls]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Unless we have -XImpredicativeTypes (which is a totally unsupported
feature), we do not want to unify
    alpha ~ (forall a. a->a) -> Int
So we look for foralls hidden inside the type, and it's convenient
to do that at the same time as the occurs check (which looks for
occurrences of alpha).

However, it's not just a question of looking for foralls /anywhere/!
Consider
   (alpha :: forall k. k->*)  ~  (beta :: forall k. k->*)
This is legal; e.g. dependent/should_compile/T11635.

We don't want to reject it because of the forall in beta's kind, but
(see Note [Occurrence checking: look inside kinds] in GHC.Core.Type)
we do need to look in beta's kind.  So we carry a flag saying if a
'forall' is OK, and switch the flag on when stepping inside a kind.

Why is it OK?  Why does it not count as impredicative polymorphism?
The reason foralls are bad is because we reply on "seeing" foralls
when doing implicit instantiation.  But the forall inside the kind is
fine.  We'll generate a kind equality constraint
  (forall k. k->*) ~ (forall k. k->*)
to check that the kinds of lhs and rhs are compatible.  If alpha's
kind had instead been
  (alpha :: kappa)
then this kind equality would rightly complain about unifying kappa
with (forall k. k->*)
