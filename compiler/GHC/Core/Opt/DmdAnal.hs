{- Note [Stamp out space leaks in demand analysis]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The demand analysis pass outputs a new copy of the Core program in
which binders have been annotated with demand and strictness
information. It's tiresome to ensure that this information is fully
evaluated everywhere that we produce it, so we just run a single
seqBinds over the output before returning it, to ensure that there are
no references holding on to the input Core program.

This makes a ~30% reduction in peak memory usage when compiling
DynFlags (cf #9675 and #13426).

This is particularly important when we are doing late demand analysis,
since we don't do a seqBinds at any point thereafter. Hence code
generation would hold on to an extra copy of the Core program, via
unforced thunks in demand or strictness information; and it is the
most memory-intensive part of the compilation process, so this added
seqBinds makes a big difference in peak memory usage.

Note [Analysing top-level bindings]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Consider a CoreProgram like
  e1 = ...
  n1 = ...
  e2 = \a b -> ... fst (n1 a b) ...
  n2 = \c d -> ... snd (e2 c d) ...
  ...
where e* are exported, but n* are not.
Intuitively, we can see that @n1@ is only ever called with two arguments
and in every call site, the first component of the result of the call
is evaluated. Thus, we'd like it to have idDemandInfo @LCL(CM(P(1L,A))@.
NB: We may *not* give e2 a similar annotation, because it is exported and
external callers might use it in arbitrary ways, expressed by 'topDmd'.
This can then be exploited by Nested CPR and eta-expansion,
see Note [Why care for top-level demand annotations?].

How do we get this result? Answer: By analysing the program as if it was a let
expression of this form:
  let e1 = ... in
  let n1 = ... in
  let e2 = ... in
  let n2 = ... in
  (e1,e2, ...)
E.g. putting all bindings in nested lets and returning all exported binders in a tuple.
Of course, we will not actually build that CoreExpr! Instead we faithfully
simulate analysis of said expression by adding the free variable 'DmdEnv'
of @e*@'s strictness signatures to the 'DmdType' we get from analysing the
nested bindings.

And even then the above form blows up analysis performance in T10370:
If @e1@ uses many free variables, we'll unnecessarily carry their demands around
with us from the moment we analyse the pair to the moment we bubble back up to
the binding for @e1@. So instead we analyse as if we had
  let e1 = ... in
  (e1, let n1 = ... in
  (    let e2 = ... in
  (e2, let n2 = ... in
  (    ...))))
That is, a series of right-nested pairs, where the @fst@ are the exported
binders of the last enclosing let binding and @snd@ continues the nested
lets.

Variables occurring free in RULE RHSs are to be handled the same as exported Ids.
See also Note [Absence analysis for stable unfoldings and RULES].

Note [Why care for top-level demand annotations?]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Reading Note [Analysing top-level bindings], you might think that we go through
quite some trouble to get useful demands for top-level bindings. They can never
be strict, for example, so why bother?

First, we get to eta-expand top-level bindings that we weren't able to
eta-expand before without Call Arity. From T18894b:
  module T18894b (f) where
  eta :: Int -> Int -> Int
  eta x = if fst (expensive x) == 13 then \y -> ... else \y -> ...
  f m = ... eta m 2 ... eta 2 m ...
Since only @f@ is exported, we see all call sites of @eta@ and can eta-expand to
arity 2.

The call demands we get for some top-level bindings will also allow Nested CPR
to unbox deeper. From T18894:
  module T18894 (h) where
  g m n = (2 * m, 2 `div` n)
  {-# NOINLINE g #-}
  h :: Int -> Int
  h m = ... snd (g m 2) ... uncurry (+) (g 2 m) ...
Only @h@ is exported, hence we see that @g@ is always called in contexts were we
also force the division in the second component of the pair returned by @g@.
This allows Nested CPR to evaluate the division eagerly and return an I# in its
position.

Note [Anticipating ANF in demand analysis]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When analysing non-complex (e.g., trivial) thunks and complex function
arguments, we have to pretend that the expression is really in administrative
normal form (ANF), the conversion to which is done by CorePrep.

Consider
```
f x = let y = x |> co in y `seq` y `seq` ()
```
E.g., 'y' is a let-binding with a trivial RHS. That may occur if 'y' can't be
inlined, for example. Now, is 'x' used once? It may appear as if that is the
case, since its only occurrence is in 'y's memoised RHS. But actually, CorePrep
will *not* allocate a thunk for 'y', because it is trivial and could just
re-use the memoisation mechanism of 'x'! By saying that 'x' is used once it
becomes a single-entry thunk and a call to 'f' will evaluate it twice.
The same applies to trivial arguments, e.g., `f z` really evaluates `z` twice.

So, somewhat counter-intuitively, trivial arguments and let RHSs will *not* be
memoised. On the other hand, evaluation of non-trivial arguments and let RHSs
*will* be memoised. In fact, consider the effect of conversion to ANF on complex
function arguments (as done by 'GHC.Core.Prep.mkFloat'):
```
f2 (g2 x) ===> let y = g2 x in f2 y                   (if `y` is lifted)
f3 (g3 x) ===> case g3 x of y { __DEFAULT -> f3 y }   (if `y` is not lifted)
```
So if a lifted argument like `g2 x` is complex enough, it will be memoised.
Regardless how many times 'f2' evaluates its parameter, the argument will be
evaluated at most once to WHNF.
Similarly, when an unlifted argument like `g3 x` is complex enough, we will
evaluate it *exactly* once to WHNF, no matter how 'f3' evaluates its parameter.

Note that any evaluation beyond WHNF is not affected by memoisation. So this
Note affects the outer 'Card' of a 'Demand', but not its nested 'SubDemand'.
'anticipateANF' predicts the effect of case-binding and let-binding complex
arguments, as well as the lack of memoisation for trivial let RHSs.
In particular, this takes care of the gripes in
Note [Analysing with absent demand] relating to unlifted types.

Note [Analysing with absent demand]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Suppose we analyse an expression with demand A.  The "A" means
"absent", so this expression will never be needed. What should happen?
There are several wrinkles:

* We *do* want to analyse the expression regardless.
  Reason: Note [Always analyse in virgin pass]

  But we can post-process the results to ignore all the usage
  demands coming back. This is done by 'multDmdType' with the appropriate
  (absent) evaluation cardinality A or B.

* Nevertheless, which sub-demand should we pick for analysis?
  Since the demand was absent, any would do. Worker/wrapper will replace
  absent bindings with an absent filler anyway, so annotations in the RHS
  of an absent binding don't matter much.
  Picking 'botSubDmd' would be the most useful, but would also look a bit
  misleading in the Core output of DmdAnal, because all nested annotations would
  be bottoming. Better pick 'seqSubDmd', so that we annotate many of those
  nested bindings with A themselves.

* Since we allow unlifted arguments that are not ok-for-speculation,
  we need to be extra careful in the following situation, because unlifted
  values are evaluated even if they are not used. Example from #9254:
     f :: (() -> (# Int#, () #)) -> ()
          -- Strictness signature is
          --    <1C1(P(A,1L))>
          -- I.e. calls k, but discards first component of result
     f k = case k () of (# _, r #) -> r

     g :: Int -> ()
     g y = f (\n -> (# case y of I# y2 -> y2, n #))

  Here, f's strictness signature says (correctly) that it calls its argument
  function and ignores the first component of its result.

  But in function g, we *will* evaluate the 'case y of ...', because it has type
  Int#. So in the program as written, 'y' will be evaluated. Hence we must
  record this usage of 'y', else 'g' will say 'y' is absent, and will w/w so
  that 'y' is bound to an absent filler (see Note [Absent fillers]), leading
  to a crash when 'y' is evaluated.

  Now, worker/wrapper could be smarter and replace `case y of I# y2 -> y2`
  with a suitable absent filler such as `RUBBISH[IntRep] @Int#`.
  But as long as worker/wrapper isn't equipped to do so, we must be cautious,
  and follow Note [Anticipating ANF in demand analysis]. That is, in
  'dmdAnalStar', we will set the evaluation cardinality to C_11, anticipating
  the case binding of the complex argument `case y of I# y2 -> y2`. This
  cardinlities' only effect is in the call to 'multDmdType', where it makes sure
  that the demand on the arg's free variable 'y' is not absent and strict, so
  that it is ultimately passed unboxed to 'g'.

Note [Always analyse in virgin pass]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Tricky point: make sure that we analyse in the 'virgin' pass. Consider
   rec { f acc x True  = f (...rec { g y = ...g... }...)
         f acc x False = acc }
In the virgin pass for 'f' we'll give 'f' a very strict (bottom) type.
That might mean that we analyse the sub-expression containing the
E = "...rec g..." stuff in a bottom demand.  Suppose we *didn't analyse*
E, but just returned botType.

Then in the *next* (non-virgin) iteration for 'f', we might analyse E
in a weaker demand, and that will trigger doing a fixpoint iteration
for g.  But *because it's not the virgin pass* we won't start g's
iteration at bottom.  Disaster.  (This happened in $sfibToList' of
nofib/spectral/fibheaps.)

So in the virgin pass we make sure that we do analyse the expression
at least once, to initialise its signatures.

Note [Which scrutinees may throw precise exceptions]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is the specification of 'exprMayThrowPreciseExceptions',
which is important for Scenario 2 of
Note [Precise exceptions and strictness analysis] in GHC.Types.Demand.

For an expression @f a1 ... an :: ty@ we determine that
  1. False  If ty is *not* @State# RealWorld@ or an unboxed tuple thereof.
            This check is done by 'forcesRealWorld'.
            (Why not simply unboxed pairs as above? This is motivated by
            T13380{d,e}.)
  2. False  If f is a PrimOp, and it is *not* raiseIO#
  3. False  If f is an unsafe FFI call ('PlayRisky')
  _. True   Otherwise "give up".

It is sound to return False in those cases, because
  1. We don't give any guarantees for unsafePerformIO, so no precise exceptions
     from pure code.
  2. raiseIO# is the only primop that may throw a precise exception.
  3. Unsafe FFI calls may not interact with the RTS (to throw, for example).
     See haddock on GHC.Types.ForeignCall.PlayRisky.

We *need* to return False in those cases, because
  1. We would lose too much strictness in pure code, all over the place.
  2. We would lose strictness for primops like getMaskingState#, which
     introduces a substantial regression in
     GHC.IO.Handle.Internals.wantReadableHandle.
  3. We would lose strictness for code like GHC.Fingerprint.fingerprintData,
     where an intermittent FFI call to c_MD5Init would otherwise lose
     strictness on the arguments len and buf, leading to regressions in T9203
     (2%) and i386's haddock.base (5%). Tested by T13380f.

In !3014 we tried a more sophisticated analysis by introducing ConOrDiv (nic)
to the Divergence lattice, but in practice it turned out to be hard to untaint
from 'topDiv' to 'conDiv', leading to bugs, performance regressions and
complexity that didn't justify the single fixed testcase T13380c.

Note [Demand analysis for recursive data constructors]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
T11545 features a single-product, recursive data type
  data A = A A A ... A
    deriving Eq
Naturally, `(==)` is deeply strict in `A` and in fact will never terminate. That
leads to very large (exponential in the depth) demand signatures and fruitless
churn in boxity analysis, demand analysis and worker/wrapper.

So we detect `A` as a recursive data constructor (see
Note [Detecting recursive data constructors]) analysing `case x of A ...`
and simply assume L for the demand on field binders, which is the same code
path as we take for sum types. This code happens in want_precise_field_dmds
in the Case equation for dmdAnal.

Combined with the B demand on the case binder, we get the very small demand
signature <1S><1S>b on `(==)`. This improves ghc/alloc performance on T11545
tenfold! See also Note [CPR for recursive data constructors] which describes the
sibling mechanism in CPR analysis.

Note [Demand on the scrutinee of a product case]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When figuring out the demand on the scrutinee of a product case,
we use the demands of the case alternative, i.e. id_dmds.
But note that these include the demand on the case binder;
see Note [Demand on case-alternative binders].
This is crucial. Example:
   f x = case x of y { (a,b) -> k y a }
If we just take scrut_demand = 1P(L,A), then we won't pass x to the
worker, so the worker will rebuild
     x = (a, absent-error)
and that'll crash.

Note [Demand on case-alternative binders]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The demand on a binder in a case alternative comes
  (a) From the demand on the binder itself
  (b) From the demand on the case binder
Forgetting (b) led directly to #10148.

Example. Source code:
  f x@(p,_) = if p then foo x else True

  foo (p,True) = True
  foo (p,q)    = foo (q,p)

After strictness analysis, forgetting (b):
  f = \ (x_an1 [Dmd=1P(1L,ML)] :: (Bool, Bool)) ->
      case x_an1
      of wild_X7 [Dmd=MP(ML,ML)]
      { (p_an2 [Dmd=1L], ds_dnz [Dmd=A]) ->
      case p_an2 of _ {
        False -> GHC.Types.True;
        True -> foo wild_X7 }

Note that ds_dnz is syntactically dead, but the expression bound to it is
reachable through the case binder wild_X7. Now watch what happens if we inline
foo's wrapper:
  f = \ (x_an1 [Dmd=1P(1L,ML)] :: (Bool, Bool)) ->
      case x_an1
      of _ [Dmd=MP(ML,ML)]
      { (p_an2 [Dmd=1L], ds_dnz [Dmd=A]) ->
      case p_an2 of _ {
        False -> GHC.Types.True;
        True -> $wfoo_soq GHC.Types.True ds_dnz }

Look at that! ds_dnz has come back to life in the call to $wfoo_soq! A second
run of demand analysis would no longer infer ds_dnz to be absent.
But unlike occurrence analysis, which infers properties of the *syntactic*
shape of the program, the results of demand analysis describe expressions
*semantically* and are supposed to be mostly stable across Simplification.
That's why we should better account for (b).
In #10148, we ended up emitting a single-entry thunk instead of an updateable
thunk for a let binder that was an an absent case-alt binder during DmdAnal.

This is needed even for non-product types, in case the case-binder
is used but the components of the case alternative are not.

Note [Aggregated demand for cardinality]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
FIXME: This Note should be named [LetUp vs. LetDown] and probably predates
said separation. SG

We use different strategies for strictness and usage/cardinality to
"unleash" demands captured on free variables by bindings. Let us
consider the example:

f1 y = let {-# NOINLINE h #-}
           h = y
       in  (h, h)

We are interested in obtaining cardinality demand U1 on |y|, as it is
used only in a thunk, and, therefore, is not going to be updated any
more. Therefore, the demand on |y|, captured and unleashed by usage of
|h| is U1. However, if we unleash this demand every time |h| is used,
and then sum up the effects, the ultimate demand on |y| will be U1 +
U1 = U. In order to avoid it, we *first* collect the aggregate demand
on |h| in the body of let-expression, and only then apply the demand
transformer:

transf[x](U) = {y |-> U1}

so the resulting demand on |y| is U1.

The situation is, however, different for strictness, where this
aggregating approach exhibits worse results because of the nature of
|both| operation for strictness. Consider the example:

f y c =
  let h x = y |seq| x
   in case of
        True  -> h True
        False -> y

It is clear that |f| is strict in |y|, however, the suggested analysis
will infer from the body of |let| that |h| is used lazily (as it is
used in one branch only), therefore lazy demand will be put on its
free variable |y|. Conversely, if the demand on |h| is unleashed right
on the spot, we will get the desired result, namely, that |f| is
strict in |y|.

-- | If given the (local, non-recursive) let-bound 'Id', 'useLetUp' determines

{- Note [Demand analysis for join points]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Consider
   g :: (Int,Int) -> Int
   g (p,q) = p+q

   f :: T -> Int -> Int
   f x p = g (join j y = (p,y)
              in case x of
                   A -> j 3
                   B -> j 4
                   C -> (p,7))

If j was a vanilla function definition, we'd analyse its body with
evalDmd, and think that it was lazy in p.  But for join points we can
do better!  We know that j's body will (if called at all) be evaluated
with the demand that consumes the entire join-binding, in this case
the argument demand from g.  Whizzo!  g evaluates both components of
its argument pair, so p will certainly be evaluated if j is called.

For f to be strict in p, we need /all/ paths to evaluate p; in this
case the C branch does so too, so we are fine.  So, as usual, we need
to transport demands on free variables to the call site(s).  Compare
Note [Lazy and unleashable free variables].

The implementation is easy.  When analysing a join point, we can
analyse its body with the demand from the entire join-binding (written
let_dmd here).

Another win for join points!  #13543.

However, note that the strictness signature for a join point can
look a little puzzling.  E.g.

    (join j x = \y. error "urk")
    (in case v of              )
    (     A -> j 3             )  x
    (     B -> j 4             )
    (     C -> \y. blah        )

The entire thing is in a C1(L) context, so j's strictness signature
will be    [A]b
meaning one absent argument, returns bottom.  That seems odd because
there's a \y inside.  But it's right because when consumed in a C1(L)
context the RHS of the join point is indeed bottom.

Note [Demand signatures are computed for a threshold demand based on idArity]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We compute demand signatures assuming idArity incoming arguments to approximate
behavior for when we have a call site with at least that many arguments. idArity
is /at least/ the number of manifest lambdas, but might be higher for PAPs and
trivial RHS (see Note [Demand analysis for trivial right-hand sides]).

Because idArity of a function varies independently of its cardinality
properties (cf. Note [idArity varies independently of dmdTypeDepth]), we
implicitly encode the arity for when a demand signature is sound to unleash
in its 'dmdTypeDepth' (cf. Note [Understanding DmdType and DmdSig] in
GHC.Types.Demand). It is unsound to unleash a demand signature when the
incoming number of arguments is less than that.
See Note [What are demand signatures?] in GHC.Types.Demand for more details
on soundness.

Why idArity arguments? Because that's a conservative estimate of how many
arguments we must feed a function before it does anything interesting with them.
Also it elegantly subsumes the trivial RHS and PAP case.

There might be functions for which we might want to analyse for more incoming
arguments than idArity. Example:

  f x =
    if expensive
      then \y -> ... y ...
      else \y -> ... y ...

We'd analyse `f` under a unary call demand C1(L), corresponding to idArity
being 1. That's enough to look under the manifest lambda and find out how a
unary call would use `x`, but not enough to look into the lambdas in the if
branches.

On the other hand, if we analysed for call demand C1(C1(L)), we'd get useful
strictness info for `y` (and more precise info on `x`) and possibly CPR
information, but

  * We would no longer be able to unleash the signature at unary call sites
  * Performing the worker/wrapper split based on this information would be
    implicitly eta-expanding `f`, playing fast and loose with divergence and
    even being unsound in the presence of newtypes, so we refrain from doing so.
    Also see Note [Don't eta expand in w/w] in GHC.Core.Opt.WorkWrap.

Since we only compute one signature, we do so for arity 1. Computing multiple
signatures for different arities (i.e., polyvariance) would be entirely
possible, if it weren't for the additional runtime and implementation
complexity.

Note [idArity varies independently of dmdTypeDepth]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In general, an Id `f` has two independently varying attributes:

* f's idArity, and
* the dmdTypeDepth of f's demand signature

For example, if f's demand signature is <L><L>, f's arity could be
greater than, or less than 2. Why?  Because both are conservative
approximations:

* Arity n means "does no expensive work until applied to at least n args"
  (e.g. (f x1..xm) is cheap to bring to HNF for m<n)

* Dmd sig with n args means "here is how to transform the incoming demand
  when applied to n args".  This is /semantic/ property, unrelated to
  arity. See GHC.Types.Demand Note [Understanding DmdType and DmdSig]

We used to check in GHC.Core.Lint that dmdTypeDepth <= idArity for a let-bound
identifier. But that means we would have to zap demand signatures every time we
reset or decrease arity.

For example, consider the following expression:

    (let go x y = `x` seq ... in go) |> co

`go` might have a strictness signature of `<1L><L>`. The simplifier will identify
`go` as a nullary join point through `joinPointBinding_maybe` and float the
coercion into the binding, leading to an arity decrease:

    join go = (\x y -> `x` seq ...) |> co in go

With the CoreLint check, we would have to zap `go`'s perfectly viable strictness
signature.

However, in the case of a /bottoming/ signature, f : <L><L>b, we /can/
say that f's arity is no greater than 2, because it'd be false to say
that f does no work when applied to 3 args.  Lint checks this constraint,
in `GHC.Core.Lint.lintLetBind`.

Note [Demand analysis for trivial right-hand sides]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Consider
    foo = plusInt |> co
where plusInt is an arity-2 function with known strictness.  Clearly
we want plusInt's strictness to propagate to foo!  But because it has
no manifest lambdas, it won't do so automatically, and indeed 'co' might
have type (Int->Int->Int) ~ T.

Fortunately, GHC.Core.Opt.Arity gives 'foo' arity 2, which is enough for LetDown to
forward plusInt's demand signature, and all is well (see Note [Newtype arity] in
GHC.Core.Opt.Arity)! A small example is the test case NewtypeArity.

Note [Absence analysis for stable unfoldings and RULES]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Ticket #18638 shows that it's really important to do absence analysis
for stable unfoldings. Consider

   g = blah

   f = \x.  ...no use of g....
   {- f's stable unfolding is f = \x. ...g... -}

If f is ever inlined we use 'g'. But f's current RHS makes no use
of 'g', so if we don't look at the unfolding we'll mark g as Absent,
and transform to

   g = error "Entered absent value"
   f = \x. ...
   {- f's stable unfolding is f = \x. ...g... -}

Now if f is subsequently inlined, we'll use 'g' and ... disaster.

SOLUTION: if f has a stable unfolding, adjust its DmdEnv (the demands
on its free variables) so that no variable mentioned in its unfolding
is Absent.  This is done by the function Demand.keepAliveDmdEnv.

ALSO: do the same for Ids free in the RHS of any RULES for f.

PS: You may wonder how it can be that f's optimised RHS has somehow
discarded 'g', but when f is inlined we /don't/ discard g in the same
way. I think a simple example is
   g = (a,b)
   f = \x.  fst g
   {-# INLINE f #-}

Now f's optimised RHS will be \x.a, but if we change g to (error "..")
(since it is apparently Absent) and then inline (\x. fst g) we get
disaster.  But regardless, #18638 was a more complicated version of
this, that actually happened in practice.

Note [Boxity for bottoming functions]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Consider (A)
    indexError :: Show a => (a, a) -> a -> String -> b
    -- Str=<..><1!P(S,S)><1S><S>b
    indexError rng i s = error (show rng ++ show i ++ show s)

    get :: (Int, Int) -> Int -> [a] -> a
    get p@(l,u) i xs
      | l <= i, i < u = xs !! (i-u)
      | otherwise     = indexError p i "get"

The hot path of `get` certainly wants to unbox `p` as well as `l` and
`u`, but the unimportant, diverging error path needs `l::a` and `u::a`
boxed, since `indexError` can't unbox them because they are polymorphic.
This pattern often occurs in performance sensitive code that does
bounds-checking.

So we want to give `indexError` a signature like `<1!P(!S,!S)><1!S><S!S>b`
where the !S (meaning Poly Unboxed C1N) says that the polymorphic arguments
are unboxed (recursively).  The wrapper for `indexError` won't /acutally/
unbox them (because their polymorphic type doesn't allow that) but when
demand-analysing /callers/, we'll behave as if that call needs the args
unboxed.

Then at call sites of `indexError`, we will end up doing some
reboxing, because `$windexError` still takes boxed arguments. This
reboxing should usually float into the slow, diverging code path; but
sometimes (sadly) it doesn't: see Note [Reboxed crud for bottoming calls].

Here is another important case (B):
    f x = Just x  -- Suppose f is not inlined for some reason
                  -- Main point: f takes its argument boxed

    wombat x = error (show (f x))

    g :: Bool -> Int -> a
    g True  x = x+1
    g False x = wombat x

Again we want `wombat` to pretend to take its Int-typed argument unboxed,
even though it has to pass it boxed to `f`, so that `g` can take its
arugment unboxed (and rebox it before calling `wombat`).

So here's what we do: while summarising `indexError`'s boxity signature in
`finaliseArgBoxities`:

* To address (B), for bottoming functions, we start by using `unboxDeeplyDmd`
  to make all its argument demands unboxed, right to the leaves; regardless
  of what the analysis said.

* To address (A), for bottoming functions, in the DontUnbox case when the
  argument is a type variable, we /refrain/ from using trimBoxity.
  (Remember the previous bullet: we have already doen `unboxDeeplyDmd`.)

Wrinkle:

* Remember Note [No lazy, Unboxed demands in demand signature]. So
  unboxDeeplyDmd doesn't recurse into lazy demands.  It's extremely unusual
  to have lazy demands in the arguments of a bottoming function anyway.
  But it can happen, when the demand analyser gives up because it
  encounters a recursive data type; see Note [Demand analysis for recursive
  data constructors].

Note [Reboxed crud for bottoming calls]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
For functions like `get` in Note [Boxity for bottoming functions], it's clear
that the reboxed crud will be floated inside to the call site of `$windexError`.
But here's an example where that is not the case:
```hs
import GHC.Ix

theresCrud :: Int -> Int -> Int
theresCrud x y = go x
  where
    go 0 = index (0,y) 0
    go 1 = index (x,y) 1
    go n = go (n-1)
    {-# NOINLINE theresCrud #-}
```
If you look at the Core, you'll see that `y` will be reboxed and used in the
two exit join points for the `$windexError` calls, while `x` is only reboxed in the
exit join point for `index (x,y) 1` (happens in lvl below):
```
$wtheresCrud = \ ww ww1 ->
      let { y = I# ww1 } in
      join { lvl2 = ... case lvl1 ww y of wild { }; ... } in
      join { lvl3 = ... case lvl y of wild { }; ... } in
      ...
```
This is currently a bug that we willingly accept and it's documented in #21128.

{- Note [Finalising boxity for demand signatures]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The worker/wrapper pass must strictly adhere to the boxity decisions
encoded in the demand signature, because that is the information that
demand analysis propagates throughout the program. Failing to
implement the strategy laid out in the signature can result in
reboxing in unexpected places. Hence, we must completely anticipate
unboxing decisions during demand analysis and reflect these decicions
in demand annotations. That is the job of 'finaliseArgBoxities',
which is defined here and called from demand analysis.

Here is a list of different Notes it has to take care of:

  * Note [No lazy, Unboxed demands in demand signature] such as `L!P(L)` in
    general, but still allow Note [Unboxing evaluated arguments]
  * Note [No nested Unboxed inside Boxed in demand signature] such as `1P(1!L)`
  * Note [mkWWstr and unsafeCoerce]

NB: Then, the worker/wrapper blindly trusts the boxity info in the
demand signature; that is why 'canUnboxArg' does not look at
strictness -- it is redundant to do so.

Note [Finalising boxity for let-bound Ids]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Consider
  let x = e in body
where the demand on 'x' is 1!P(blah).  We want to unbox x according to
Note [Thunk splitting] in GHC.Core.Opt.WorkWrap.  We must do this becuase
worker/wrapper ignores stricness and looks only at boxity flags; so if
x's demand is L!P(blah) we might still split it (wrongly).  We want to
switch to Boxed on any lazy demand.

That is what finaliseLetBoxity does.  It has no worker-arg budget, so it
is much simpler than finaliseArgBoxities.

Note [No nested Unboxed inside Boxed in demand signature]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Consider
```
f p@(x,y)
  | even (x+y) = []
  | otherwise  = [p]
```
Demand analysis will infer that the function body puts a demand of `1P(1!L,1!L)`
on 'p', e.g., Boxed on the outside but Unboxed on the inside. But worker/wrapper
can't unbox the pair components without unboxing the pair! So we better say
`1P(1L,1L)` in the demand signature in order not to spread wrong Boxity info.
That happens via the call to trimBoxity in 'finaliseArgBoxities'/'finaliseLetBoxity'.

Note [No lazy, Unboxed demands in demand signature]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Consider T19407:

  data Huge = Huge Bool () ... () -- think: DynFlags
  data T = T { h :: Huge, n :: Int }
  f t@(T h _) = g h t
  g (H b _ ... _) t = if b then 1 else n t

The body of `g` puts (approx.) demand `L!P(A,1)` on `t`. But we better
not put that demand in `g`'s demand signature, because worker/wrapper will not
in general unbox a lazy-and-unboxed demand like `L!P(..)`.
(The exception are known-to-be-evaluated arguments like strict fields,
see Note [Unboxing evaluated arguments].)

The program above is an example where spreading misinformed boxity through the
signature is particularly egregious. If we give `g` that signature, then `f`
puts demand `S!P(1!P(1L,A,..),ML)` on `t`. Now we will unbox `t` in `f` it and
we get

  f (T (H b _ ... _) n) = $wf b n
  $wf b n = $wg b (T (H b x ... x) n)
  $wg = ...

Massive reboxing in `$wf`! Solution: Trim boxity on lazy demands in
'trimBoxity', modulo Note [Unboxing evaluated arguments].

Note [Unboxing evaluated arguments]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Consider this program (due to Roman):

    data X a = X !a

    foo :: X Int -> Int -> Int
    foo x@(X a) n = go 0
     where
       go i | i < n     = a + go (i+1)
            | otherwise = 0

We want the worker for 'foo' to look like this:

    $wfoo :: Int# -> Int# -> Int#

with the first argument unboxed, so that it is not eval'd each time around the
'go' loop (which would otherwise happen, since 'foo' is not strict in 'a'). It
is sound for the wrapper to pass an unboxed arg because X is strict
(see Note [Strictness and Unboxing] in "GHC.Core.Opt.DmdAnal"), so its argument
must be evaluated. And if we *don't* pass an unboxed argument, we can't even
repair it by adding a `seq` thus:

    foo (X a) n = a `seq` go 0

because the seq is discarded (very early) since X is strict!

So here's what we do

* Since this has nothing to do with how 'foo' uses 'a', we leave demand
  analysis alone, but account for the additional evaluatedness when
  annotating the binder 'finaliseArgBoxities', which will retain the Unboxed
  boxity on 'a' in the definition of 'foo' in the demand 'L!P(L)'; meaning
  it's used lazily but unboxed nonetheless. This seems to contradict Note
  [No lazy, Unboxed demands in demand signature], but we know that 'a' is
  evaluated and thus can be unboxed.

* When 'finaliseArgBoxities' decides to unbox a record, it will zip the field demands
  together with the respective 'StrictnessMark'. In case of 'x', it will pair
  up the lazy field demand 'L!P(L)' on 'a' with 'MarkedStrict' to account for
  the strict field.

* Said 'StrictnessMark' is passed to the recursive invocation of 'go_args' in
  'finaliseArgBoxities' when deciding whether to unbox 'a'. 'a' was used lazily, but
  since it also says 'MarkedStrict', we'll retain the 'Unboxed' boxity on 'a'.

* Worker/wrapper will consult 'canUnboxArg' for its unboxing decision. It will
  /not/ look at the strictness bits of the demand, only at Boxity flags. As such,
  it will happily unbox 'a' despite the lazy demand on it.

The net effect is that boxity analysis and the w/w transformation are more
aggressive about unboxing the strict arguments of a data constructor than when
looking at strictness info exclusively. It is very much like (Nested) CPR, which
needs its nested fields to be evaluated in order for it to unbox nestedly.

There is the usual danger of reboxing, which as usual we ignore. But
if X is monomorphic, and has an UNPACK pragma, then this optimisation
is even more important.  We don't want the wrapper to rebox an unboxed
argument, and pass an Int to $wfoo!

This works in nested situations like T10482

                 False -> ...

The extra eagerness lets us produce a worker of type:
     $wfoo :: Int# -> Int# -> Int# -> Int -> Int
     $wfoo p# q# y# = ...

even though the `case x` is only lazily evaluated.

--------- Historical note ------------
We used to add data-con strictness demands when demand analysing case
expression. However, it was noticed in #15696 that this misses some cases. For
instance, consider the program (from T10482)

    data family Bar a
    data instance Bar (a, b) = BarPair !(Bar a) !(Bar b)
    newtype instance Bar Int = Bar Int

    foo :: Bar ((Int, Int), Int) -> Int -> Int
    foo f k =
      case f of
        BarPair x y -> case burble of
                          True -> case x of
                                    BarPair p q -> ...
                          False -> ...

We really should be able to assume that `p` is already evaluated since it came
from a strict field of BarPair. This strictness would allow us to produce a
worker of type:

    $wfoo :: Int# -> Int# -> Int# -> Int -> Int
    $wfoo p# q# y# = ...

even though the `case x` is only lazily evaluated

Indeed before we fixed #15696 this would happen since we would float the inner
`case x` through the `case burble` to get:

    foo f k =
      case f of
        BarPair x y -> case x of
                          BarPair p q -> case burble of
                                          True -> ...
                                          False -> ...

However, after fixing #15696 this could no longer happen (for the reasons
discussed in ticket:15696#comment:76). This means that the demand placed on `f`
would then be significantly weaker (since the False branch of the case on
`burble` is not strict in `p` or `q`).

Consequently, we now instead account for data-con strictness in mkWWstr_one,
applying the strictness demands to the final result of DmdAnal. The result is
that we get the strict demand signature we wanted even if we can't float
the case on `x` up through the case on `burble`.

Note [Do not unbox class dictionaries]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If we have
   f :: Ord a => [a] -> Int -> a
   {-# INLINABLE f #-}
and we worker/wrapper f, we'll get a worker with an INLINABLE pragma
(see Note [Worker/wrapper for INLINABLE functions] in GHC.Core.Opt.WorkWrap),
which can still be specialised by the type-class specialiser, something like
   fw :: Ord a => [a] -> Int# -> a

BUT if f is strict in the Ord dictionary, we might unpack it, to get
   fw :: (a->a->Bool) -> [a] -> Int# -> a
and the type-class specialiser can't specialise that. An example is #6056.

But in any other situation, a dictionary is just an ordinary value,
and can be unpacked.  So we track the INLINABLE pragma, and discard the boxity
flag in finaliseArgBoxities (see the isClassPred test).

Historical note: #14955 describes how I got this fix wrong the first time.

Note that the simplicity of this fix implies that INLINE functions (such as
wrapper functions after the WW run) will never say that they unbox class
dictionaries. That's not ideal, but not worth losing sleep over, as INLINE
functions will have been inlined by the time we run demand analysis so we'll
see the unboxing around the worker in client modules. I got aware of the issue
in T5075 by the change in boxity of loop between demand analysis runs.

Note [Worker argument budget]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In 'finaliseArgBoxities' we don't want to generate workers with zillions of
argument when, say given a strict record with zillions of fields.  So we
limit the maximum number of worker args to the maximum of
  - -fmax-worker-args=N
  - The number of args in the original function; if it already has has
    zillions of arguments we don't want to seek /fewer/ args in the worker.
(Maybe we should /add/ them instead of maxing?)

We pursue a "layered" strategy for unboxing: we unbox the top level of the
argument(s), subject to budget; if there are any arguments left we unbox the
next layer, using that depleted budget.

To achieve this, we use the classic almost-circular programming technique in
which we we write one pass that takes a lazy list of the Budgets for every
layer.

Note [The OPAQUE pragma and avoiding the reboxing of arguments]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/13143 it was identified that when
a function 'f' with a NOINLINE pragma is W/W transformed, then the worker for
'f' should get the NOINLINE annotation, while the wrapper /should/ be inlined.

That's because if the wrapper for 'f' had stayed NOINLINE, then any worker of a
W/W-transformed /caller of/ 'f' would immediately rebox any unboxed arguments
that is applied to the wrapper of 'f'. When the wrapper is inlined, that kind of
reboxing does not happen.

But now we have functions with OPAQUE pragmas, which by definition (See Note
[OPAQUE pragma]) do not get W/W-transformed. So in order to avoid reboxing
workers of any W/W-transformed /callers of/ 'f' we need to strip all boxity
information from 'f' in the demand analysis. This will inform the
W/W-transformation code that boxed arguments of 'f' must definitely be passed
along in boxed form and as such dissuade the creation of reboxing workers.

{- Note [Safe abortion in the fixed-point iteration]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Fixed-point iteration may fail to terminate. But we cannot simply give up and
return the environment and code unchanged! We still need to do one additional
round, for two reasons:

 * To get information on used free variables (both lazy and strict!)
   (see Note [Lazy and unleashable free variables])
 * To ensure that all expressions have been traversed at least once, and any left-over
   strictness annotations have been updated.

This final iteration does not add the variables to the strictness signature
environment, which effectively assigns them 'nopSig' (see "getStrictness")

Note [Trimming a demand to a type]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There are two reasons we sometimes trim a demand to match a type.
  1. GADTs
  2. Recursive products and widening

More on both below.  But the botttom line is: we really don't want to
have a binder whose demand is more deeply-nested than its type
"allows". So in findBndrDmd we call trimToType and findTypeShape to
trim the demand on the binder to a form that matches the type

Now to the reasons. For (1) consider
  f :: a -> Bool
  f x = case ... of
          A g1 -> case (x |> g1) of (p,q) -> ...
          B    -> error "urk"

where A,B are the constructors of a GADT.  We'll get a 1P(L,L) demand
on x from the A branch, but that's a stupid demand for x itself, which
has type 'a'. Indeed we get ASSERTs going off (notably in
splitUseProdDmd, #8569).

For (2) consider
  data T = MkT Int T    -- A recursive product
  f :: Int -> T -> Int
  f 0 _         = 0
  f _ (MkT n t) = f n t

Here f is lazy in T, but its *usage* is infinite: P(L,P(L,P(L, ...))).
Notice that this happens because T is a product type, and is recrusive.
If we are not careful, we'll fail to iterate to a fixpoint in dmdFix,
and bale out entirely, which is inefficient and over-conservative.

Worse, as we discovered in #18304, the size of the usages we compute
can grow /exponentially/, so even 10 iterations costs far too much.
Especially since we then discard the result.

To avoid this we use the same findTypeShape function as for (1), but
arrange that it trims the demand if it encounters the same type constructor
twice (or three times, etc).  We use our standard RecTcChecker mechanism
for this -- see GHC.Core.Opt.WorkWrap.Utils.findTypeShape.

This is usually call "widening".  We could do it just in dmdFix, but
since are doing this findTypeShape business /anyway/ because of (1),
and it has all the right information to hand, it's extremely
convenient to do it there.

{- Note [NOINLINE and strictness]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
At one point we disabled strictness for NOINLINE functions, on the
grounds that they should be entirely opaque.  But that lost lots of
useful semantic strictness information, so now we analyse them like
any other function, and pin strictness information on them.

That in turn forces us to worker/wrapper them; see
Note [Worker/wrapper for NOINLINE functions] in GHC.Core.Opt.WorkWrap.


Note [Lazy and unleashable free variables]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We put the strict and once-used FVs in the DmdType of the Id, so
that at its call sites we unleash demands on its strict fvs.
An example is 'roll' in imaginary/wheel-sieve2
Something like this:
        roll x = letrec
                     go y = if ... then roll (x-1) else x+1
                 in
                 go ms
We want to see that roll is strict in x, which is because
go is called.   So we put the DmdEnv for x in go's DmdType.

Another example:

        f :: Int -> Int -> Int
        f x y = let t = x+1
            h z = if z==0 then t else
                  if z==1 then x+1 else
                  x + h (z-1)
        in h y

Calling h does indeed evaluate x, but we can only see
that if we unleash a demand on x at the call site for t.

Incidentally, here's a place where lambda-lifting h would
lose the cigar --- we couldn't see the joint strictness in t/x

        ON THE OTHER HAND

We don't want to put *all* the fv's from the RHS into the
DmdType. Because

 * it makes the strictness signatures larger, and hence slows down fixpointing

and

 * it is useless information at the call site anyways:
   For lazy, used-many times fv's we will never get any better result than
   that, no matter how good the actual demand on the function at the call site
   is (unless it is always absent, but then the whole binder is useless).

Therefore we exclude lazy multiple-used fv's from the environment in the
DmdType.

But now the signature lies! (Missing variables are assumed to be absent.) To
make up for this, the code that analyses the binding keeps the demand on those
variable separate (usually called "lazy_fv") and adds it to the demand of the
whole binding later.

What if we decide _not_ to store a strictness signature for a binding at all, as
we do when aborting a fixed-point iteration? The we risk losing the information
that the strict variables are being used. In that case, we take all free variables
mentioned in the (unsound) strictness signature, conservatively approximate the
demand put on them (topDmd), and add that to the "lazy_fv" returned by "dmdFix".

{- Note [Making dictionaries strict]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Opt_DictsStrict flag makes GHC use call-by-value for dictionaries.  Why?

* Generally CBV is more efficient.

* Dictionaries are always non-bottom; and never take much work to
  compute.  E.g. a dfun from an instance decl always returns a dicionary
  record immediately.  See DFunUnfolding in CoreSyn.
  See also Note [Recursive superclasses] in TcInstDcls.

* The strictness analyser will then unbox dictionaries and pass the
  methods individually, rather than in a bundle.  If there are a lot of
  methods that might be bad; but worker/wrapper already does throttling.

* A newtype dictionary is *not* always non-bottom.  E.g.
      class C a where op :: a -> a
      instance C Int where op = error "urk"
  Now a value of type (C Int) is just a newtype wrapper (a cast) around
  the error thunk.  Don't strictify these!

See #17758 for more background and perf numbers.

The implementation is extremly simple: just make the strictness
analyser strictify the demand on a dictionary binder in
'findBndrDmd'.

However there is one case where this can make performance worse.
For the principle consider some function at the core level:
    myEq :: Eq a => a -> a -> Bool
    myEq eqDict x y = ((==) eqDict) x y
If we make the dictionary strict then WW can fire turning this into:
    $wmyEq :: (a -> a -> Bool) -> a -> a -> Bool
    $wmyEq eq x y = eq x y
Which *usually* performs better. However if the dictionary is known we
are far more likely to inline a function applied to the dictionary than
to inline one applied to a function. Sometimes this makes just enough
of a difference to stop a function from inlining. This is documented in #18421.

It's somewhat similar to Note [Do not unbox class dictionaries] although
here our problem is with the inliner, not the specializer.

Note [Initialising strictness]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
See section 9.2 (Finding fixpoints) of the paper.

Our basic plan is to initialise the strictness of each Id in a
recursive group to "bottom", and find a fixpoint from there.  However,
this group B might be inside an *enclosing* recursive group A, in
which case we'll do the entire fixpoint shebang on for each iteration
of A. This can be illustrated by the following example:

Example:

  f [] = []
  f (x:xs) = let g []     = f xs
                 g (y:ys) = y+1 : g ys
              in g (h x)

At each iteration of the fixpoint for f, the analyser has to find a
fixpoint for the enclosed function g. In the meantime, the demand
values for g at each iteration for f are *greater* than those we
encountered in the previous iteration for f. Therefore, we can begin
the fixpoint for g not with the bottom value but rather with the
result of the previous analysis. I.e., when beginning the fixpoint
process for g, we can start from the demand signature computed for g
previously and attached to the binding occurrence of g.

To speed things up, we initialise each iteration of A (the enclosing
one) from the result of the last one, which is neatly recorded in each
binder.  That way we make use of earlier iterations of the fixpoint
algorithm. (Cunning plan.)

But on the *first* iteration we want to *ignore* the current strictness
of the Id, and start from "bottom".  Nowadays the Id can have a current
strictness, because interface files record strictness for nested bindings.
To know when we are in the first iteration, we look at the ae_virgin
field of the AnalEnv.


Note [Final Demand Analyser run]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Some of the information that the demand analyser determines is not always
preserved by the simplifier.  For example, the simplifier will happily rewrite
  \y [Demand=MU] let x = y in x + x
to
  \y [Demand=MU] y + y
which is quite a lie: Now y occurs more than just once.

The once-used information is (currently) only used by the code
generator, though.  So:

 * We zap the used-once info in the worker-wrapper;
   see Note [Zapping Used Once info in WorkWrap] in
   GHC.Core.Opt.WorkWrap.
   If it's not reliable, it's better not to have it at all.

 * Just before TidyCore, we add a pass of the demand analyser,
      but WITHOUT subsequent worker/wrapper and simplifier,
   right before TidyCore.  See SimplCore.getCoreToDo.

   This way, correct information finds its way into the module interface
   (strictness signatures!) and the code generator (single-entry thunks!)

Note that, in contrast, the single-call information (CM(..)) /can/ be
relied upon, as the simplifier tends to be very careful about not
duplicating actual function calls.

Also see #11731.

Note [Space Leaks in Demand Analysis]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Ticket: #15455
MR: !5399

In the past the result of demand analysis was not forced until the whole module
had finished being analysed. In big programs, this led to a big build up of thunks
which were all ultimately forced at the end of the analysis.

This was because the return type of the analysis was a lazy pair:
  dmdAnal :: AnalEnv -> SubDemand -> CoreExpr -> (DmdType, CoreExpr)
To avoid space leaks we added extra bangs to evaluate the DmdType component eagerly; but
we were never sure we had added enough.
The easiest way to systematically fix this was to use a strict pair type for the
return value of the analysis so that we can be more confident that the result
is incrementally computed rather than all at the end.

A second, only loosely related point is that
the updating of Ids was not forced because the result of updating
an Id was placed into a lazy field in CoreExpr. This meant that until the end of
demand analysis, the unforced Ids would retain the DmdEnv which the demand information
was fetch from. Now we are quite careful to force Ids before putting them
back into core expressions so that we can garbage-collect the environments more eagerly.
For example see the `Case` branch of `dmdAnal'` where `case_bndr'` is forced
or `dmdAnalSumAlt`.

The net result of all these improvements is the peak live memory usage of compiling
jsaddle-dom decreases about 4GB (from 6.5G to 2.5G). A bunch of bytes allocated benchmarks also
decrease because we allocate a lot fewer thunks which we immediately overwrite and
also runtime for the pass is faster! Overall, good wins.
