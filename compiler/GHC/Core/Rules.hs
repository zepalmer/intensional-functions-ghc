Note [Overall plumbing for rules]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* After the desugarer:
   - The ModGuts initially contains mg_rules :: [CoreRule] of
     locally-declared rules for imported Ids.
   - Locally-declared rules for locally-declared Ids are attached to
     the IdInfo for that Id.  See Note [Attach rules to local ids] in
     GHC.HsToCore.Binds

* GHC.Iface.Tidy strips off all the rules from local Ids and adds them to
  mg_rules, so that the ModGuts has *all* the locally-declared rules.

* The HomePackageTable contains a ModDetails for each home package
  module.  Each contains md_rules :: [CoreRule] of rules declared in
  that module.  The HomePackageTable grows as ghc --make does its
  up-sweep.  In batch mode (ghc -c), the HPT is empty; all imported modules
  are treated by the "external" route, discussed next, regardless of
  which package they come from.

* The ExternalPackageState has a single eps_rule_base :: RuleBase for
  Ids in other packages.  This RuleBase simply grow monotonically, as
  ghc --make compiles one module after another.

  During simplification, interface files may get demand-loaded,
  as the simplifier explores the unfoldings for Ids it has in
  its hand.  (Via an unsafePerformIO; the EPS is really a cache.)
  That in turn may make the EPS rule-base grow.  In contrast, the
  HPT never grows in this way.

* The result of all this is that during Core-to-Core optimisation
  there are four sources of rules:

    (a) Rules in the IdInfo of the Id they are a rule for.  These are
        easy: fast to look up, and if you apply a substitution then
        it'll be applied to the IdInfo as a matter of course.

    (b) Rules declared in this module for imported Ids, kept in the
        ModGuts. If you do a substitution, you'd better apply the
        substitution to these.  There are seldom many of these.

    (c) Rules declared in the HomePackageTable.  These never change.

    (d) Rules in the ExternalPackageTable. These can grow in response
        to lazy demand-loading of interfaces.

* At the moment (c) is carried in a reader-monad way by the GHC.Core.Opt.Monad.
  The HomePackageTable doesn't have a single RuleBase because technically
  we should only be able to "see" rules "below" this module; so we
  generate a RuleBase for (c) by combing rules from all the modules
  "below" us.  That's why we can't just select the home-package RuleBase
  from HscEnv.

  [NB: we are inconsistent here.  We should do the same for external
  packages, but we don't.  Same for type-class instances.]

* So in the outer simplifier loop, we combine (b-d) into a single
  RuleBase, reading
     (b) from the ModGuts,
     (c) from the GHC.Core.Opt.Monad, and
     (d) from its mutable variable
  [Of course this means that we won't see new EPS rules that come in
  during a single simplifier iteration, but that probably does not
  matter.]

\subsection[specialisation-IdInfo]{Specialisation info about an @Id@}
*                                                                      *
************************************************************************

A @CoreRule@ holds details of one rule for an @Id@, which
includes its specialisations.

For example, if a rule for @f@ contains the mapping:
\begin{verbatim}
        forall a b d. [Type (List a), Type b, Var d]  ===>  f' a b
\end{verbatim}
then when we find an application of f to matching types, we simply replace
it by the matching RHS:
\begin{verbatim}
        f (List Int) Bool dict ===>  f' Int Bool
\end{verbatim}
All the stuff about how many dictionaries to discard, and what types
to apply the specialised function to, are handled by the fact that the
Rule contains a template for the result of the specialisation.

There is one more exciting case, which is dealt with in exactly the same
way.  If the specialised value is unboxed then it is lifted at its
definition site and unlifted at its uses.  For example:

        pi :: forall a. Num a => a

might have a specialisation

        [Int#] ===>  (case pi' of Lift pi# -> pi#)

where pi' :: Lift Int# is the specialised version of pi.

Note [Care with roughTopName]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Consider this
    module M where { x = a:b }
    module N where { ...f x...
                     RULE f (p:q) = ... }
You'd expect the rule to match, because the matcher can
look through the unfolding of 'x'.  So we must avoid roughTopName
returning 'M.x' for the call (f x), or else it'll say "can't match"
and we won't even try!!

However, suppose we have
         RULE g (M.h x) = ...
         foo = ...(g (M.k v))....
where k is a *function* exported by M.  We never really match
functions (lambdas) except by name, so in this case it seems like
a good idea to treat 'M.k' as a roughTopName of the call.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The rules for an Id come from two places:
  (a) the ones it is born with, stored inside the Id itself (idCoreRules fn),
  (b) rules added in other modules, stored in the global RuleBase (imp_rules)

It's tempting to think that
     - LocalIds have only (a)
     - non-LocalIds have only (b)

but that isn't quite right:

     - PrimOps and ClassOps are born with a bunch of rules inside the Id,
       even when they are imported

     - The rules in GHC.Core.Opt.ConstantFold.builtinRules should be active even
       in the module defining the Id (when it's a LocalId), but
       the rules are kept in the global RuleBase

{- Note [Extra args in the target]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If we find a matching rule, we return (Just (rule, rhs)),
/but/ the rule firing has only consumed as many of the input args
as the ruleArity says.  The unused arguments are handled by the code in
GHC.Core.Opt.Simplify.tryRules, using the arity of the returned rule.

E.g. Rule "foo":  forall a b.  f p1 p2 = rhs
     Target:      f e1 e2 e3

Then lookupRule returns Just (Rule "foo", rhs), where Rule "foo"
has ruleArity 2.  The real rewrite is
        f e1 e2 e3 ==> rhs e3

You might think it'd be cleaner for lookupRule to deal with the
leftover arguments, by applying 'rhs' to them, but the main call
in the Simplifier works better as it is.  Reason: the 'args' passed
to lookupRule are the result of a lazy substitution

Historical note:

At one stage I tried to match even if there are more args in the
/template/ than the target.  I now think this is probably a bad idea.
Should the template (map f xs) match (map g)?  I think not.  For a
start, in general eta expansion wastes work.  SLPJ July 99

{- Note [Unbound RULE binders]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
It can be the case that the binder in a rule is not actually
bound on the LHS:

* Type variables.  Type synonyms with phantom args can give rise to
  unbound template type variables.  Consider this (#10689,
  simplCore/should_compile/T10689):

    type Foo a b = b

    f :: Eq a => a -> Bool
    f x = x==x

    {-# RULES "foo" forall (x :: Foo a Char). f x = True #-}
    finkle = f 'c'

  The rule looks like
    forall (a::*) (d::Eq Char) (x :: Foo a Char).
         f (Foo a Char) d x = True

  Matching the rule won't bind 'a', and legitimately so.  We fudge by
  pretending that 'a' is bound to (Any :: *).

* Coercion variables.  On the LHS of a RULE for a local binder
  we might have
    RULE forall (c :: a~b). f (x |> c) = e
  Now, if that binding is inlined, so that a=b=Int, we'd get
    RULE forall (c :: Int~Int). f (x |> c) = e
  and now when we simplify the LHS (Simplify.simplRule) we
  optCoercion (look at the CoVarCo case) will turn that 'c' into Refl:
    RULE forall (c :: Int~Int). f (x |> <Int>) = e
  and then perhaps drop it altogether.  Now 'c' is unbound.

  It's tricky to be sure this never happens, so instead I
  say it's OK to have an unbound coercion binder in a RULE
  provided its type is (c :: t~t).  Then, when the RULE
  fires we can substitute <t> for c.

  This actually happened (in a RULE for a local function)
  in #13410, and also in test T10602.

Note [Cloning the template binders]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Consider the following match (example 1):
        Template:  forall x.  f x
        Target:               f (x+1)
This should succeed, because the template variable 'x' has nothing to
do with the 'x' in the target.

Likewise this one (example 2):
        Template:  forall x. f (\x.x)
        Target:              f (\y.y)

We achieve this simply by using rnBndrL to clone the template
binders if they are already in scope.

------ Historical note -------
At one point I tried simply adding the template binders to the
in-scope set /without/ cloning them, but that failed in a horribly
obscure way in #14777.  Problem was that during matching we look
up target-term variables in the in-scope set (see Note [Lookup
in-scope]).  If a target-term variable happens to name-clash with a
template variable, that lookup will find the template variable, which
is /utterly/ bogus.  In #14777, this transformed a term variable
into a type variable, and then crashed when we wanted its idInfo.

{- Note [rv_lcl in RuleMatchEnv]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Consider matching
  Template: \x->f
  Target:   \f->f

where 'f' is free in the template. When we meet the lambdas we must
remember to rename f :-> f' in the target, as well as x :-> f
in the template.  The rv_lcl::RnEnv2 does that.

Similarly, consider matching
     Template: {a}  \b->b
     Target:        \a->3
We must rename the \a.  Otherwise when we meet the lambdas we might
substitute [b :-> a] in the template, and then erroneously succeed in
matching what looks like the template variable 'a' against 3.

So we must add the template vars to the in-scope set before starting;
see `init_menv` in `matchN`.

{- Note [Casts in the target]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
As far as possible we don't want casts in the target to get in the way of
matching.  E.g.
* (let bind in e)  |> co
* (case e of alts) |> co
* (\ a b. f a b)   |> co

In the first two cases we want to float the cast inwards so we can match on
the let/case.  This is not important in practice because the Simplifier does
this anyway.

But the third case /is/ important: we don't want the cast to get in the way
of eta-reduction.  See Note [Cancel reflexive casts] for a real life example.

The most convenient thing is to make 'match' take an MCoercion argument, thus:

* The main matching function
      match env subst template target mco
  matches   template ~ (target |> mco)

* Invariant: typeof( subst(template) ) = typeof( target |> mco )

Note that for applications
     (e1 e2) ~ (d1 d2) |> co
where 'co' is non-reflexive, we simply fail.  You might wonder about
     (e1 e2) ~ ((d1 |> co1) d2) |> co2
but the Simplifer pushes the casts in an application to to the
right, if it can, so this doesn't really arise.

Note [Coercion arguments]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
What if we have (f co) in the template, where the 'co' is a coercion
argument to f?  Right now we have nothing in place to ensure that a
coercion /argument/ in the template is a variable.  We really should,
perhaps by abstracting over that variable.

C.f. the treatment of dictionaries in GHC.HsToCore.Binds.decompseRuleLhs.

For now, though, we simply behave badly, by failing in match_co.
We really should never rely on matching the structure of a coercion
(which is just a proof).

Note [Casts in the template]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Consider the definition
  f x = e,
and SpecConstr on call pattern
  f ((e1,e2) |> co)

We'll make a RULE
   RULE forall a,b,g.  f ((a,b)|> g) = $sf a b g
   $sf a b g = e[ ((a,b)|> g) / x ]

So here is the invariant:

  In the template, in a cast (e |> co),
  the cast `co` is always a /variable/.

Matching should bind that variable to an actual coercion, so that we
can use it in $sf.  So a Cast on the LHS (the template) calls
match_co, which succeeds when the template cast is a variable -- which
it always is.  That is why match_co has so few cases.

See also
* Note [Coercion arguments]
* Note [Matching coercion variables] in GHC.Core.Unify.
* Note [Cast swizzling on rule LHSs] in GHC.Core.Opt.Simplify.Utils:
  sm_cast_swizzle is switched off in the template of a RULE

{- Note [Lambdas in the template]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If we match
   Template:   (\x. blah_template)
   Target:     (\y. blah_target)
then we want to match inside the lambdas, using rv_lcl to match up
x and y.

But what about this?
   Template   (\x. (blah1 |> cv))
   Target     (\y. blah2) |> co

This happens quite readily, because the Simplifier generally moves
casts outside lambdas: see Note [Casts and lambdas] in
GHC.Core.Opt.Simplify.Utils. So, tiresomely, we want to push `co`
back inside, which is what `exprIsLambda_maybe` does.  But we've
stripped off that cast, so now we need to put it back, hence mkCastMCo.

Unlike the target, where we attempt eta-reduction, we do not attempt
to eta-reduce the template, and may therefore fail on
  Template:   \x. f True x
  Target      f True

It's not especially easy to deal with eta reducing the template,
and never happens, because no one write eta-expanded left-hand-sides.

{- Note [Eta reduction in the target]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Suppose we are faced with this (#19790)
   Template {x}  f x
   Target        (\a b c. let blah in f x a b c)

You might wonder why we have an eta-expanded target (see first subtle
point below), but regardless of how it came about, we'd like
eta-expansion not to impede matching.

So eta_reduce does on-the-fly eta-reduction of the target expression.
Given (\a b c. let blah in e a b c), it returns (let blah in e).

Subtle points:
* Consider a target:  \x. f <expensive> x
  In the main eta-reducer we do not eta-reduce this, because doing so
  might reduce the arity of the expression (from 1 to zero, because of
  <expensive>).  But for rule-matching we /do/ want to match template
  (f a) against target (\x. f <expensive> x), with a := <expensive>

  This is a compelling reason for not relying on the Simplifier's
  eta-reducer.

* The Lam case of eta_reduce renames as it goes. Consider
  (\x. \x. f x x).  We should not eta-reduce this.  As we go we rename
  the first x to x1, and the second to x2; then both argument x's are x2.

* eta_reduce does /not/ need to check that the bindings 'blah'
  and expression 'e' don't mention a b c; but it /does/ extend the
  rv_lcl RnEnv2 (see rn_bndr in eta_reduce).
  * If 'blah' mentions the binders, the let-float rule won't
    fire; and
  * if 'e' mentions the binders we we'll also fail to match
    e.g. because of the exprFreeVars test in match_tmpl_var.

  Example: Template: {x}  f a         -- Some top-level 'a'
           Target:   (\a b. f a a b)  -- The \a shadows top level 'a'
  Then eta_reduce will /succeed/, with
      (rnEnvR = [a :-> a'], f a)
  The returned RnEnv will map [a :-> a'], where a' is fresh. (There is
  no need to rename 'b' because (in this example) it is not in scope.
  So it's as if we'd returned (f a') from eta_reduce; the renaming applied
  to the target is simply deferred.

Note [Cancel reflexive casts]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Here is an example (from #19790) which we want to catch
   (f x) ~ (\a b. (f x |> co) a b) |> sym co
where
   f :: Int -> Stream
   co :: Stream ~ T1 -> T2 -> T3

when we eta-reduce (\a b. blah a b) to 'blah', we'll get
  (f x) ~ (f x) |> co |> sym co

and we really want to spot that the co/sym-co cancels out.
Hence
  * We keep an invariant that the MCoercion is always MRefl
    if the MCoercion is reflextve
  * We maintain this invariant via the call to checkReflexiveMCo
    in the Cast case of 'match'.

{- Note [Matching variable types]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When matching x ~ e, where 'x' is a template variable, we must check that
x's type matches e's type, to establish (TypeInv).  For example
  forall (c::Char->Int) (x::Char).
     f (c x) = "RULE FIRED"
We must not match on, say (f (pred (3::Int))).

It's actually quite difficult to come up with an example that shows
you need type matching, esp since matching is left-to-right, so type
args get matched first.  But it's possible (e.g. simplrun008) and this
is the Right Thing to do.

An alternative would be to make (TypeInf) into a /pre-condition/.  It
is threatened only by the App rule.  So when matching an application
(e1 e2) ~ (d1 d2) would be to collect args of the application chain,
match the types of the head, then match arg-by-arg.

However that alternative seems a bit more complicated.  And by
matching types at variables we do one match_ty for each template
variable, rather than one for each application chain.  Usually there are
fewer template variables, although for simple rules it could be the other
way around.

Note [Expanding variables]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Here is another Very Important rule: if the term being matched is a
variable, we expand it so long as its unfolding is "expandable". (Its
occurrence information is not necessarily up to date, so we don't use
it.)  By "expandable" we mean a WHNF or a "constructor-like" application.
This is the key reason for "constructor-like" Ids.  If we have
     {-# NOINLINE [1] CONLIKE g #-}
     {-# RULE f (g x) = h x #-}
then in the term
   let v = g 3 in ....(f v)....
we want to make the rule fire, to replace (f v) with (h 3).

Note [Do not expand locally-bound variables]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Do *not* expand locally-bound variables, else there's a worry that the
unfolding might mention variables that are themselves renamed.
Example
          case x of y { (p,q) -> ...y... }
Don't expand 'y' to (p,q) because p,q might themselves have been
renamed.  Essentially we only expand unfoldings that are "outside"
the entire match.

Hence, (a) the guard (not (isLocallyBoundR v2))
       (b) when we expand we nuke the renaming envt (nukeRnEnvR).

Note [Tick annotations in RULE matching]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We used to unconditionally look through ticks in both template and
expression being matched. This is actually illegal for counting or
cost-centre-scoped ticks, because we have no place to put them without
changing entry counts and/or costs. So now we just fail the match in
these cases.

On the other hand, where we are allowed to insert new cost into the
tick scope, we can float them upwards to the rule application site.

Moreover, we may encounter ticks in the template of a rule. There are a few
ways in which these may be introduced (e.g. #18162, #17619). Such ticks are
ignored by the matcher. See Note [Simplifying rules] in
GHC.Core.Opt.Simplify.Utils for details.

cf Note [Tick annotations in call patterns] in GHC.Core.Opt.SpecConstr


Note [Matching lets]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Matching a let-expression.  Consider
        RULE forall x.  f (g x) = <rhs>
and target expression
        f (let { w=R } in g E))
Then we'd like the rule to match, to generate
        let { w=R } in (\x. <rhs>) E
In effect, we want to float the let-binding outward, to enable
the match to happen.  This is the WHOLE REASON for accumulating
bindings in the RuleSubst

We can only do this if the free variables of R are not bound by the
part of the target expression outside the let binding; e.g.
        f (\v. let w = v+1 in g E)
Here we obviously cannot float the let-binding for w.  Hence the
use of okToFloat.

There are a couple of tricky points:
  (a) What if floating the binding captures a variable that is
      free in the entire expression?
        f (let v = x+1 in v) v
      --> NOT!
        let v = x+1 in f (x+1) v

  (b) What if the let shadows a local binding?
        f (\v -> (v, let v = x+1 in (v,v))
      --> NOT!
        let v = x+1 in f (\v -> (v, (v,v)))

  (c) What if two non-nested let bindings bind the same variable?
        f (let v = e1 in b1) (let v = e2 in b2)
      --> NOT!
        let v = e1 in let v = e2 in (f b2 b2)
      See testsuite test `T4814`.

Our cunning plan is this:
  (1) Along with the growing substitution for template variables
      we maintain a growing set of floated let-bindings (rs_binds)
      plus the set of variables thus bound (rs_bndrs).

  (2) The RnEnv2 in the MatchEnv binds only the local binders
      in the term (lambdas, case), not the floated let-bndrs.

  (3) When we encounter a `let` in the term to be matched, in the Let
      case of `match`, we use `okToFloat` to check that it does not mention any
      locally bound (lambda, case) variables.  If so we fail.

  (4) In the Let case of `match`, we use GHC.Core.Subst.substBind to
      freshen the binding (which, remember (3), mentions no locally
      bound variables), in a lexically-scoped way (via rv_fltR in
      MatchEnv).

      The subtle point is that we want an in-scope set for this
      substitution that includes /two/ sets:
      * The in-scope variables at this point, so that we avoid using
        those local names for the floated binding; points (a) and (b) above.
      * All "earlier" floated bindings, so that we avoid using the
        same name for two different floated bindings; point (c) above.

      Because we have to compute the in-scope set here, the in-scope set
      stored in `rv_fltR` is always ignored; we leave it only because it's
      convenient to have `rv_fltR :: Subst` (with an always-ignored `InScopeSet`)
      rather than storing three separate substitutions.

  (5) We apply that freshening substitution, in a lexically-scoped
      way to the term, although lazily; this is the rv_fltR field.

See #4814, which is an issue resulting from getting this wrong.

Note [Matching cases]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
{- NOTE: This idea is currently disabled.  It really only works if
         the primops involved are OkForSpeculation, and, since
         they have side effects readIntOfAddr and touch are not.
         Maybe we'll get back to this later .  -}

Consider
   f (case readIntOffAddr# p# i# realWorld# of { (# s#, n# #) ->
      case touch# fp s# of { _ ->
      I# n# } } )
This happened in a tight loop generated by stream fusion that
Roman encountered.  We'd like to treat this just like the let
case, because the primops concerned are ok-for-speculation.
That is, we'd like to behave as if it had been
   case readIntOffAddr# p# i# realWorld# of { (# s#, n# #) ->
   case touch# fp s# of { _ ->
   f (I# n# } } )

Note [Lookup in-scope]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Consider this example
        foo :: Int -> Maybe Int -> Int
        foo 0 (Just n) = n
        foo m (Just n) = foo (m-n) (Just n)

SpecConstr sees this fragment:

        case w_smT of wild_Xf [Just A] {
          Data.Maybe.Nothing -> lvl_smf;
          Data.Maybe.Just n_acT [Just S(L)] ->
            case n_acT of wild1_ams [Just A] { GHC.Base.I# y_amr [Just L] ->
              $wfoo_smW (GHC.Prim.-# ds_Xmb y_amr) wild_Xf
            }};

and correctly generates the rule

        RULES: "SC:$wfoo1" [0] __forall {y_amr [Just L] :: GHC.Prim.Int#
                                          sc_snn :: GHC.Prim.Int#}
          $wfoo_smW sc_snn (Data.Maybe.Just @ GHC.Base.Int (GHC.Base.I# y_amr))
          = $s$wfoo_sno y_amr sc_snn ;]

BUT we must ensure that this rule matches in the original function!
Note that the call to $wfoo is
            $wfoo_smW (GHC.Prim.-# ds_Xmb y_amr) wild_Xf

During matching we expand wild_Xf to (Just n_acT).  But then we must also
expand n_acT to (I# y_amr).  And we can only do that if we look up n_acT
in the in-scope set, because in wild_Xf's unfolding it won't have an unfolding
at all.

That is why the 'lookupRnInScope' call in the (Var v2) case of 'match'
is so important.
