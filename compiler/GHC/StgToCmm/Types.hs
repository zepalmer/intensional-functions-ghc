Note [Conveying CAF-info and LFInfo between modules]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some information about an Id is generated in the code generator, and is not
available earlier.  Namely:

* CAF info.   Code motion in Cmm or earlier phases may move references around so
  we compute information about which bits of code refer to which CAF late in the
  Cmm pipeline.

* LambdaFormInfo. This records the details of a closure representation,
  including
    - the final arity (for functions)
    - whether it is a data constructor, and if so its tag

Collectively we call this CgInfo (see GHC.StgToCmm.Types).

It's very useful for importing modules to have this information. We can always
make a conservative assumption, but that is bad: e.g.

* For CAF info, if we know nothing we have to assume it is a CAF which bloats
  the SRTs of the importing module.

  Conservative assumption here is made when creating new Ids.

* For data constructors, we really like having well-tagged pointers. See #14677,
  #16559, #15155, and wiki: commentary/rts/haskell-execution/pointer-tagging

  Conservative assumption here is made when we import an Id without a
  LambdaFormInfo in the interface, in GHC.StgToCmm.Closure.mkLFImported.

So we arrange to always serialise this information into the interface file.  The
moving parts are:

* We record the CgInfo in the IdInfo of the Id.

* GHC.Driver.Pipeline: the call to updateModDetailsIdInfos augments the
  ModDetails constructed at the end of the Core pipeline, with CgInfo
  gleaned from the back end.  The hard work is done in GHC.Iface.UpdateIdInfos.

* For ModIface we generate the final ModIface with CgInfo in
  GHC.Iface.Make.mkFullIface.

* We don't absolutely guarantee to serialise the CgInfo: we won't if you have
  -fomit-interface-pragmas or -fno-code; and we won't read it in if you have
  -fignore-interface-pragmas.  (We could revisit this decision.)

Note [Imported unlifted nullary datacon wrappers must have correct LFInfo]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
As described in `Note [Conveying CAF-info and LFInfo between modules]`,
imported unlifted nullary datacons must have their LambdaFormInfo set to
reflect the fact that they are evaluated . This is necessary as otherwise
references to them may be passed untagged to code that expects tagged
references.

What may be less obvious is that this must be done for not only datacon
workers but also *wrappers*. The reason is found in this program
from #23146:

    module B where

    type NP :: [UnliftedType] -> UnliftedType
    data NP xs where
      UNil :: NP '[]


    module A where
    import B

    fieldsSam :: NP xs -> NP xs -> Bool
    fieldsSam UNil UNil = True

    x = fieldsSam UNil UNil

Due to its GADT nature, `B.UNil` produces a trivial wrapper

    $WUNil :: NP '[]
    $WUNil = UNil @'[] @~(<co:1>)

which is referenced in the RHS of `A.x`. If we fail to give `$WUNil` the
correct `LFCon 0` `LambdaFormInfo` then we will end up passing an untagged
pointer to `fieldsSam`. This is problematic as `fieldsSam` may take advantage
of the unlifted nature of its arguments by omitting handling of the zero
tag when scrutinising them.

The fix is straightforward: extend the logic in `mkLFImported` to cover
(nullary) datacon wrappers as well as workers. This is safe because we
know that the wrapper of a nullary datacon will be in WHNF, even if it
includes equalities evidence (since such equalities are not runtime
relevant). This fixed #23146.
