T4806a.hs:1:1: error:
    Could not load module ‘Data.Map’
    It is a member of the package ‘containers-0.6.5.1’
    which is unusable because the -ignore-package flag was used to ignore at least one of its dependencies:
      deepseq-1.4.6.1
    Use -v (or `:set -v` in ghci) to see a list of the files searched for.
