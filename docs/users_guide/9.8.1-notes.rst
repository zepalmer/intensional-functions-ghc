.. _release-9-8-1:

Version 9.8.1
=============

Language
~~~~~~~~

- GHC Proposal `#425
  <https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/blob/master/proposals/0425-decl-invis-binders.rst>`_
  has been partially implemented. Namely, the ``@k``-binders in type declarations are now permitted::

    type T :: forall k. k -> forall j. j -> Type
    data T @k (a :: k) @(j :: Type) (b :: j)

  This feature is guarded behind :extension:`TypeAbstractions`.

Compiler
~~~~~~~~

- Added a new warning :ghc-flag:`-Wterm-variable-capture` that helps to make code compatible with
  the future extension ``RequiredTypeArguments``.

- Rewrite rules now support a limited form of higher order matching when a
  pattern variable is applied to distinct locally bound variables. For example: ::

      forall f. foo (\x -> f x)

  Now matches: ::

      foo (\x -> x*2 + x)

GHCi

Runtime system
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- On POSIX systems that support timerfd, RTS shutdown no longer has to wait for
  the next RTS 'tick' to occur before continuing the shutdown process. See #22692.
